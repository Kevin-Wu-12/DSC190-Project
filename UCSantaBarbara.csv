🧠 Hey everyone — we’re building Unitutor, a peer tutoring network created by students at UCSB.



Right now we’re recruiting tutors — especially for pre-major and GE classes.

💸 0% platform commission — you keep everything you earn

🕒 Fully flexible hours

💬 You set your own rate, students pick based on your profile and bid.



Early tutors will get priority exposure when we open student access (more traffic &amp; bookings).



If you’ve ever thought “I could teach this better than the TA,” now’s your moment 😄



🔗 Join here: [https://unitutor-production.up.railway.app](https://unitutor-production.up.railway.app)



Subjects in high demand: Econ 1, 5, 10 · PSTAT 8, 120A · Math 34, 4A, 6A · Chem 1A, 109A · CS 8, 16 · Writing



(Students can join now too! Just note that matching’s still warming up while we add more tutors.)

UCSantaBarbara,hot,Advice on selling handmade art?,Icy_Membership4177,0,"Hello anyone! 

I am currently an undergraduate student at UCSB (will be graduating this upcoming June) and because of my schedule, I can’t get a traditional job. I still want to put in the effort to support myself and not rely too much on my family since they are struggling as well. 

Towards the end of November and being of Dec, I was hoping to set up a table on State Street to sell some handmade rosaries. It’s not going to be a regular thing but just a 1 or 2 time event. 

I don’t know where to start. I checked one art show option and it was a 1 year membership for about $600 which I cannot afford. 

I was also planning to advertise it on Facebook marketplace, here on Reddit later on, on my instagram page, Etsy, YikYak (???), and ask my church if they knew anyone… 

I already have some of my rosaries sold at the old mission gift shop but they take 50% so I would preferably like to sell independently! 

Any advice or ideas? I would appreciate any!
