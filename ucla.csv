I wasn't seeing a therapist at the time I was going through the situation but I wanted to know how hard it is to get an impacted course dropped? If i don't have supporting documentation, is the chance of getting it approved nil?

ucla,hot,Barely surviving (sophomore btw),Conscious_Bug6285,33,"Reddit is a scary place but I just wanted to post my rant. I am deep in the trenches. 

I am so scared. I genuinely lost the plot. I can’t even say I’m in survival mode because I am not even surviving. I am dying. My academic life is in shambles. What have I done ? I had potential. I just never give myself a fair shot. Im always behind in homework or readings. 

Every time I see my family the pain is worse. Because they don’t know that I genuinely don’t believe in myself anymore. Listening to their praises knowing I’m not worthy of them just [hurts.Im](http://hurts.Im) not the girl they knew before. I was the embodiment of hope in my family as a first generation college student. I have no discipline, no structure, no willpower. I am letting the wind take me wherever it pleases. I wake up to go to class, to study. I genuinely try, but I always miss the mark. Last week I had a quiz for chem on Friday. But I also had my 7L lab. Guess what? I missed both. I woke up in time for chem, but stayed in my lounge too long (starting to think I might just have ADHD IDFK). I left to go to chem and was ten minutes late. There was no way in hell I was going to do a quiz that takes 15 minutes in five. I just walked to Westwood to do some stress relief shopping with the money my granny gave me as extra spending money for college, the money she gave me to support me while I get an education. And there I was, spending it without even living the standard. Mind you, i come from a low income household. I am POOR, so even being here is a blessing in and of itself. The money that my family gives me to sustain me in college is pocket change to some but it means so much to me . 

I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to live like this. I hate myself for what I do to myself, and the support and money that I’ve wasted for the last two quarters. I have never uttered “I wanna kill myself” as much as I have now. I say it in a non-serious, cathartic manner because I have no desire to actually inflict harm on myself and I love life and the people in it too much to do that. I say it in more of a “this is too hard for me to face” kinda way. It is a little concerning though, it makes me think just how sudden a switch can flip in someones head when they decide it really is just too much for them. My heart aches for people who have committed suicide and their families, I don't want that for myself. 

I haven’t had the guts to check my emails or my canvas in days. I just can’t handle all of the things I have to do. It shouldn’t be this hard but it is because I made it this way. I’m so sick of this. I wish I gave myself a fair chance. I wish I set myself up for success. I wish I was normal, a normal student.  But I am not and I don’t know why. I can’t survive like this. I am mentally wasting away. My only job right now is to be a student and I am failing so badly at that. I do enjoy learning, I do enjoy doing hard things but once I get overwhelmed I completely drop the ball. All it takes is one late assignment in the beginning of the quarter and it's a domino effect. 

Here is where the intersectionality of my identity comes into play. Now I will talk about my faith as a Christian. Some people may relate, some may not. That's okay, this is my rant. Idk if anyone is gonna read it but hey lol.

Part of me knows that I need to get right with God  and discipline myself spiritually. I miss the person I was when I had better spiritual habits and reverence for God. When I took prayer seriously and devoted time to read the bible. I feel like I'm losing the parts I actually liked about myself, the very essence that made me, me. I actually thrive when I focus on God, because I am more disciplined, and I tend not to be on social media so I am not chasing a dopamine high and screwing up my brain chemistry. 

I am very aware that my actions have consequences. My faith in God will not help me miraculously pass my classes when I know I did not put the work in. That's not how God operates. At the same time, I know my background and all the barriers I have faced to get into this institution. I know that my faith in God was huge turning point for my life and it set me apart, caused me to strive for excellence and make it out of the trenches. My faith in God gave me purpose and I wouldn't be here without it. I think God is showing me that I need to mature, to grow up and build better habits. I can't live off mere motivation. I can't live off of the habits I had when I was younger. I can't live off of old knowledge off scripture or past experiences. I have to allow God to move in my life NOW. I love God, I am just very inconsistent which is causing me to be stagnant spiritually. 

Different aspects of life are so interconnected. Mental health, physical health, spiritual health, academics, career, family, friends. If one is off, its like a domino effect that ravages your life. 

On the bright side, the thing about spiritual maturity or growth is that it is not all on me, its of God. He just asks me to show up, to make time for Him, to sit at his feet and listen. But the actual change comes from God himself. I believe that God is faithful to finish the work that he began in me (philippians 1:6). In the times where I am most distressed, where I feel most ashamed or embarrassed, I know God hears my cries. I know that he is quick to reach out his hand and rescue me, to redeem my life from the pit (psalm 103). I know that in my lowest moments and in my highest, the one who will never leave or forsake me is God. Psalm 139:7-12 really hit different here. 

I am so scared. I am terrified of the implications of not doing so well (lets be real, doing HORRIBLY) this quarter. But it's this hope that keeps me going. I know that I put myself in this position, but I know there is room for redemption and change. The change has to start now and it IS going to be hard. I tried and failed this quarter, so ik from experience. If anyone has read this and got this far, thank you for listening to my rant. I hope this encouraged you as it did me if you are in the same predicament. Life is hard but it is worth living and growing from these challenges. 

I feel so Edgar Allen Poe for writing this (clearly I don't read enough literature).

Hey everyone,
I’ve been trying to get a job at Santa Monica UCLA for a while now, but it’s honestly been really hard. I live in LA like there’s no way no phlebotomy or medical assistant jobs are hiring!!! I’ve applied to a bunch of positions (mostly clinical/front desk/patient-related jobs) through their career website, and other jobs as well but I never hear back. I’m certified in phlebotomy and soon to be a certified medical assistant, and I really want to work somewhere like UCLA Health since that’s also where I plan to transfer for nursing.

If anyone here works at UCLA Health or has gotten hired before, do you have any advice or tips? Like are there certain positions that are easier to get into first? Should I email HR or try to connect with someone who already works there? I really want to get my foot in the door but I’m starting to feel stuck.

Any tips or experiences would seriously help a lot 🙏
