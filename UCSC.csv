First of all, why would it pop up on my account only in July if i have checked my ebill account at least 15 times since winter 2022, and there was always a balance of zero because I paid off each quarter when it was due. Second of all, I graduated in August of 2024, so it’s kind of crazy i’d be getting random charges. I think it’s a scam. I just got a letter in the mail threatening me to pay the balance by 11/27 or they’re going to come after me with the franchise tax board. This is absolutely insane.

I need students to join so it can actually happen and be a functioning class. We're going to talk about BTS and K-pop, but it's all a lens to learn stuff through and you're not required to know anything or be a fan of these things to join the class. The class is pretty easy and does not require you to do a ton of course work. It's one reading and one design-related assignment each week. There's an option to be asynchronous too and still get credit. 

I'm an undergrad doing research and design work in Baskin under Dr. Kate Ringland and this class is under a program called Research Pathways. Basically, I'm an undergrad who teaches other undergrads so more undergrads can get into research at the university. I know some people saw my post from last quarter and couldn't join in fall but wanted to join in winter.

Unfortunately, I'll be graduating from UCSC and won't be here in spring to teach a spring session of the class. But if you still want to be involved in research, then look out for other CMPM 118 classes under the research pathways program. Feel free to email me at [jhsher@ucsc.edu](mailto:jhsher@ucsc.edu) or direct message me on Reddit if you have any questions about tech-related research at UCSC. While I'm still here, I can help connect students and see if there's any opportunities available.

We have looked into multiple methods of transportation including bus, Amtrak and flights and we can’t afford for him to come home for both Thanksgiving and winter break.
