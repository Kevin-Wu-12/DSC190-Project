    "\n",
    "Reddit is one of the largest discussion and bonding platforms for college communities, especially UC's. Each UC campus' subreddit has specific cultures, trends, and content patterns. These communities are especially useful for students to voice their opinions or share a funny story!\n",
    "\n",
    "Take this as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\Screenshot 2025-11-12 225912.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze Reddit posts from various UC subreddits to predict how many upvotes a post will earn based on its content, metadata, and engagement features. We thought this was interesting because you can analyze individual UC subreddits to see the differences in culture communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a practical use being if you were a club trying to have people go to your event:\n",
    "What factors influence your post being brought up to the front page?\n",
    "Or, how you could get the most engagement out of your post?"

    "### Potential Biases:\n",
    "Our dataset is subject to several sources of bias. First, scraping from the top listing leads to an overrepresentation of already high-performing posts, which may distort our understanding of typical engagement. Additionally, subreddit sizes vary widely—for example, UC Berkeley has far more traffic than UC Merced—so posts naturally receive different levels of exposure across campuses. The timing of data collection also affects upvote counts, since recently posted content has had less time to accumulate engagement. Finally, we lack historical data for older posts, which limits our ability to analyze long-term trends or normalize upvote counts over time. (NEED TO EDIT OARAGRAPH)\n",

    "These variables allow both behavioral and structural analysis of community engagement.\n"
