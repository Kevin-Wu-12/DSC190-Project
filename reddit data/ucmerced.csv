ucmerced,hot,Highly recommend this UC-wide Climate Resilience class (PSY 129A @ Merced),Impossible_Turn8786,10,"Hey y’all, just wanted to share a class I’ve been involved with that I think more people should know about. It’s called **PSY 129A: Psyc &amp; Planetary Resilience**, and it’s honestly been one of the most grounding and meaningful experiences I’ve had at Cal.  
It’s not your typical lecture. The class mixes short talks from global climate leaders, small group discussions led by mindfulness teachers, and hands-on projects that actually make a difference. It’s all about **building personal and social resilience** while facing the climate crisis (and college stress in general).  
It’s part of a **UC-wide Climate Resilience Course** that’s now running across all 10 campuses and was even featured on NPR and UC News which is p cool.  
**Details:**  
 MWF 2:30 – 3:20pm  
 Instructor: Daniel Mello  
4 units - open to 100 students this spring (2026)  
If you’re feeling climate anxiety or just want to connect with a great community of people trying to do something meaningful, I can’t recommend it enough.  ",0.92,0,10,False,0,True,False,False,self.ucmerced,General,1762973819.0,5195,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/1ovdz1n/highly_recommend_this_ucwide_climate_resilience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/1ovdz1n/highly_recommend_this_ucwide_climate_resilience/

ucmerced,hot,chem10 opinions pls !!,vingyl,7,"Hihi,

I’ve heard many polarized opinions of chem10 at merced. lots of people are saying it’s cutthroat, others saying it’s your average college course.

next semester it’s being taught by deborah lair. I had her for a couple days before transferring out of her class, and i’ve heard she’s pretty bad and requires a LOT of self studying..

I found that the merced CC also teaches a chem10 equivalent, but it would seriously jack up my schedule if I took it instead of the one taught at uc merced, not to mention how I would probably have to take the bus to get there. However the class is being taught by dusty ventura, who i’ve heard great things about

I did dual enrollment for chemistry in highschool, so a good portion of the material won’t be completely foreign. however i really want an A in this class so im wondering if that’s even possible with deborah 🤷🏻‍♀️

ucmerced,hot,Philosophy Major/Minor at UC Merced?,Educational_Fig_8296,7,"Hello. I am a senior in high school. I have recently taken an interest in Philosophy and am exploring the different paths I may take. 

I did not find any posts about the Philosophy Department at UCM, so I made this post.

Does anyone know anything about the Philosophy program at UC Merced? 

Some questions I have include:
- Is the focus on continental or analytic philosophy?

- What kind of research goes on in the department?

- How is the feel of the learning environment? Welcoming? Intense? Collaborative?

- How does Philosophy at UCM compare to UCs that are generally more highly regarded, such as UC Berkeley and UCLA? Or even UC Riverside which, while not considered as highly ranked, has a phenomenal Philosophy program.

- How well are Philosophy students at UCM prepared for applying to PhD programs? Or the LCAT?


In terms of general UCM knowledge, I have already done lots of research on UCM and have already toured the campus. I really liked how nice professors and students seemed and how abundant different opportunities, at least portrayed, are. 

The only thing that sort of puts me off from UCM is that it’s kinda in the middle of nowhere. In a way, it kinda reminds me too much of home, as I grew up in an isolated suburb where everything around it was grazing land for cattle. Also, Merced gets pretty hot.

ucmerced,hot,Advice deciding between CSE at UCM and SE at SJSU,NOimDirtyDan--,3,"Hey everyone,

I’m transferring for Spring 2026, and I’m torn between Software Engineering (SE) at SJSU and CSE at UC Merced. Both have strong appeal for different reasons, and I could really use some insight from current students (especially UCM CSE majors) before I make my final decision. 

**Here is how I see It and some questions I have about the CSE program:**

If I go to UCM, I’d be commuting from home (about 45–60 minutes), and although I would also be commuting/carpooling to SJSU, the much shorter commute to UCM would save me a lot of time and energy to dedicate to school and everything else. 

That said, something I’ve noticed when looking through UCM’s upper-division CSE courses is that a lot of them are intro classes or theory-focused, rather than applied or project-heavy. I know that’s  the nature of the researched based UC system, but it makes me wonder how much actual hands-on experience you walk away with.

**CSE Career Questions:**

1. How competitive or effective are the internships available to CSE students? Are most local, remote, or more research-based?
2. How is networking and the alumni connection here? do professors, clubs, or past students help with internships or job leads?
3. How is the capstone/senior project structured? Does it give you real hands-on, team-based experience like what you’d get in industry?
4. How well do you feel the CSE program actually prepares you for the industry? Do you leave feeling confident in your technical skills (software design, teamwork, version control, etc.), or is it more academic/theoretical?

**CSE Campus/Academic Questions:**

1. How realistic is it to find on-campus IT or SE-related jobs (like help desk, systems support, or web dev)? I have a year of experience working for my CC's IT Help Desk and would love to find a campus job at UCM. 
2.  Has registration started already for Spring 2026?
3. Are most upper-div classes only offered in person, or are there online/hybrid options available?
4. Has Spring 2026 registration started yet, and are there any classes that tend to disappear quickly?

**TL;DR:**  
I’m deciding between SJSU’s Software Engineering and UCM’s Computer Science &amp; Engineering programs for Spring 2026. I’d really appreciate honest input from current or past UCM CSE students, especially about how well the program prepares you for the industry, internship and networking opportunities, and overall campus experience.

**Note:**  
If anyone would be open to answering some of these questions more in-depth, I’d really appreciate doing a quick call or Zoom chat sometime. As you can tell I’ve got a lot of questions and would love to hear directly from someone who’s been through it. Feel free to DM me if you’re up for it!

I’m creating a student-run Discord hub for the UC Merced psychology community. That is to say it is not affiliated with UC Merced. I'm of the belief that having separate servers for every class involves too much friction. This server is meant to consolidate psychology courses into one space.

It includes nearly every Psych course for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, subdivided by section and set up with react roles so you can easily join your current classes (and drop them when you’re done). Courses and sections will be added for each new semester as the course schedule releases from UC Merced.

I am hoping that a central space makes it easier to find classmates, share notes and relevant materials, stay connected, and ask questions in a group forum. You are welcome to share the link with peers in your psychology courses.

I’m a freshman majoring in neuroscience and I really wanted to take math011 next semester (spring26). unfortunately the only one that fits with my schedule has the smallest class size at 108 seats.

I got the november 12 time slot at 3pm (for context I think the earlier slot is nov3 and the latest is nov14) Am I completely cooked? Is there anything I can do to avoid this?? I’m lwk freaking out right now and hoping there’s some sort of work around I can do??

My friend got a november 4 timezone and is more than willing to swap times with me, can they ask their counselor to do this for us?


also off topic but do i have to re-register for every single one of my classes in spring semester? Like if im currently taking a yearlong gen chem I class do I have to register for the spring semester version of gen chem I, or will my enrollment roll over?

ucmerced,hot,Don’t come here if you’re a gay guy,Humble-Bit-2511,36,"For reference I’m a gay guy originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and also a 2nd year. Unless you want to experience both hatred and isolation due to your sexuality I’d suggest you go somewhere else. While the university itself including the staff are very accepting for the most part, and the university purposefully tries to come across as being for the students, it’s the student body that makes everything else insignificant. Majority of the men on this campus either are homophobic, or aren’t homophobic but still aren’t the most accepting. You’ll find a few good ones, but it feels as though everyone is always negative, they’re just tolerating your sexuality because they have to. As a gay guy it’s hard to find real friendships with other guys, causing you to resort to being in friend groups with only other women. You try and be nice to a guy trying to become his friend, but everyone here is so childish that they automatically assume that you’re hitting on them. And on anonymous apps like Fizz, students actually spread rampant homophobia constantly. I’ve actually experienced hateful comments and other harassment in person due to students at this university, based solely on the fact that I don’t hide my sexuality. On top of this hatred, being that you’re in such a small environment away from the actual town of Merced, it creates a sense of alienation with nothing you could really do about it, especially without a car. The gay male community here seems so small, which causes the actual gay men here to come across rude and arrogant as a defense mechanism. Especially when it comes to looking conventionally attractive or not. The culture here is that if a gay guy seems conventionally attractive (ie works out, is handsome, etc) the straight men seem to tolerate him more. Giving them a superiority complex, and pitting different gay guys against eachother. And god forbid a gay guy here portrays his femininity. And this is just in relation to platonic relationships. Gay men at this university, at least from what I’ve seen as a student, don’t really find love or romance. Sure there are a few that get lucky, but if you want any romantic connection you need to resort to gay hookup apps like Grindr or Sniffies. And the culture on those is even worse in the town of Mercedes. Students are explicit with their hatred, causing gay guys who want to experience stuff like that to resort to risky sexual encounters with much older men on those apps. The system itself is extremely negative, and it seems as though it’s going to continue at least for the foreseeable future. If you’re a gay high school senior applying to colleges, coming from another gay guy who’s stuck here due to his mental health depleting and his grades dropping, please just pick any other UC or CSU.

ucmerced,hot,Applying for Mechanical Engineering Fall 2026,Disastrous_Ad_1432,8,"Hi everyone, Im applying for the fall 2026 semester for Mechanical Engineering and I had a few questions. I toured UC Merced this year but I did not really get a vibe for how the campus is in regards to culture and community events. Im not really sure if UCM is a commuter school or not with the parking lot being the size of a small airport but I don't think that's a deterrent to me applying.

  
Mainly I would like to know how getting a mechanical engineering degree really is. I can read all about the programs and frankly amazing things UCM has done, but I am not sure the difficulty of classes or the support given for them at this moment. I understand Mechanical Engineering is a hard degree, but I would like to have some sort of balance between lecture classes and hands on learning, Im not sure if UCM offers that.

ucmerced,hot,UC Merced Physics Department? - Advice4PossibleFreshmanPhysicsMajor,Educational_Fig_8296,8,"Hi guys. I am a high school senior from Rancho Cordova (a town near Sacramento) interested in majoring in Physics at UC Merced.

I have a 3.6 unweighted GPA, 4.2 weighted GPA, and a 3.93 UC capped GPA.

I am interested in UC Merced because, from what I’ve heard, it has great research opportunities and great professors. UC Merced has the highest amount of undergrads involved in research within the UC system. Also, I believe the smaller class sizes compared to larger UCs also allow for a better learning environment because of easier access to professors.

After college, I want to pursue a PHD in some field of Physics. I think UC Merced is a great choice for me to apply to because of its smaller learning environment, easier access to professors, and opportunities to do research, which are heavily important for pursuing a PHD.

Are my assumptions correct? Is there any advice you can offer? How is the Physics Department at UC Merced? How easy is it really to get involved in research? At what year do students usually get access to research opportunities? Are there any other opportunities Physics majors have access to at UC Merced other than faculty-guided research?

Additionally, I am coming down for a tour of UC Merced’s Natural Sciences Department in a few weeks. I would be grateful if anyone could give me any helpful information about that too.
