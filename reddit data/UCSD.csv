# How do I login to check my admissions decision?

You should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).

# How does the college I got matter? Can I change college? 

For freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.

Your major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (from Seventh to Eighth). 

You cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable.

* Has anyone else had to take a GE or requirement after their last quarter and still been able to start working?
* Can I still start my job (same lab, now paid) even if my degree isn’t officially conferred until after I complete the requirement?

I would say this drink is pretty tasty and can be a little comparable to Swiss Miss (instant hot cocoa mix); just not as sweet.

UCSD,new,rant and questions,GrilledGreenBean007,0,"Hi!

I am a first year at UCSD and things have not been going that well. Classes and profs are fine but I feel like I am missing out on something. The experience here for the past 1.5 months has not been what I thought it was going to be like at all, and has been somewhat traumatic and exhausting. The campus is ugly and depressing and there is no pretty building/traditional collegiate architecture. There are so many foreign students that it does not feel like an American university, it feels sometimes like I am in Asia and I don't like it (I just wish that there was just more culturally American people like myself here). There is no football team which is kind of depressing as even though I don't like football, the games and the vibes would be cool and make for fun memories/experiences (though I know that I choose this school knowing that there is no team here). I also feel like people don't really show up that much to other sports/there is a lack of school pride/cohesion/community/unification here. I am not a big sports person myself however I think in college it is fun to root for your school and participate in things like that if you know what I mean, and I feel like there is a lack of a unifying/unified thing/community here if that makes sense. I don't know, things just seem sort of dead.

I try to look on the bright side though and see how fortunate I am to be studying here and all  of the opportunities that the school provides from the education to the location (beach, Trader Joes, Ralph's, a theater, Barnes and Noble, World Market, CVS, Target) and clubs. This school has everything I need to thrive, though I just still feel like I am not thriving in it.

One thing I do love is how here I can just do my own thing and things aren't too competitive/cut-throat. At least with the people that I have met thus far and the places that I have been people want to more or less help each other succeed, as I know that at other colleges things are much more ""toxic"", cut-throat and competitive compared to here so I like the chill, layed backed attitudes/vibes that people have here.

Overall, I just don't know. Just the whole vibe and general demographic and look of the school was not at all what I thought it was going to be and I it makes me somewhat sad and feeling like I am missing out on a true college experience. There is just **something** missing. This place just seems a little empty/odd. Does anybody else feel that way or is it just me? And please don't say that I am not reaching out enough. I am not an anti-social person and have joined quite a few clubs/things looking for ""my people"", but they seem harder to come across than what I once thought. I am still reaching out to people, looking at new clubs to join to see which ones I want to stick to, and continue to go to classes and work hard on my studies.

I still have no true friends here (though I know that it is still pretty early on in the year) and just have some people that I know a little. Of course, my overall goal here is to get my degree and just have a good/happy, well-rounded and traditional college experience.

  
Does anyone else feel like they are missing out on something by being here? Have you been able to solve it? Is it just me? I am still trying to give UCSD a chance, but I am not sure if I will stick around for all 4 years. We will have to see.
