UCDavis,top,Davis smile dentistry by the target is a scam,InitiativeExtreme462,116,"They’re a corporate dentistry office that, in my experience, cared way more about money than my actual health.

They did several fillings and a root canal + crown for me. The root canal failed and I ended up losing that tooth. Some of the fillings were drilled way too close to the nerve, so I had constant pain for about three months. One filling even came off just from flossing — it clearly wasn’t bonded well. I paid over $4,000 and was left with a messed-up mouth.

Most of those fillings now need to be redone because they’re so subpar. One of them sits way higher than my natural tooth structure, and they already drilled a huge hole close to the nerve. Redoing it is risky. I honestly don’t know what to do about that one.

Only after doing a lot of research and finally switching to an honest dentist in Davis who takes UC SHIP did I realize how bad that first place was. My new dentist is cheaper (easily 50% less), gentle, and I have no pain. The fillings actually feel like natural teeth.

Please, for your own health, be careful where you go. There are good, honest dentists in Davis. I really regret that as a freshman with no real-life experience, I didn’t notice the red flags and got taken advantage of. Now my rule with dentists is: if you don’t fully trust them, leave and find someone else.",0.97,0,116,False,24,True,False,False,self.UCDavis,,1763005439.0,55273,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1ovqvn8/davis_smile_dentistry_by_the_target_is_a_scam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1ovqvn8/davis_smile_dentistry_by_the_target_is_a_scam/

It feels like a lot of students here enjoy photography — many of us have cameras sitting around, and it could be fun to practice or take creative breaks from school. At the same time, a lot of students want nice photos (like grad pics, portraits, club events, etc.), but options can be pretty limited or expensive.

I’m exploring an idea around making photography more accessible for students, and I’d love to hear how you all currently:

* find photographers
* decide who to work with
* or approach photography if you shoot yourself

Not promoting anything — just trying to understand what students actually need and how people currently handle this.

UC Davis economist Marianne Bitler warns that these cuts -- totaling $186 billion over the next decade -- could increase hunger, deepen poverty, and limit children’s long-term health and education outcomes. 

Her research shows how food assistance programs like SNAP are not just vital lifelines, but investments in future economic stability.

UCDavis,hot,An older dude on a bike went the wrong way and crashed into me 😭 trying to find him.,Advanced-Radio1783,50,"So last Thursday, I was biking on campus, between the science lab building and the science lecture hall (red circle), about to turn right. There was kind of a traffic jam of people on bikes waiting to turn left, so this older man (looked like a professor) decided to go into the wrong lane to avoid them. Problem is, I was in that lane turning right. So we collided head-on. He kinda stopped to ask if I was okay, and I (completely in shock) just said “yeah” because I didn’t even process what happened. He then rode off. I was not okay. I was bleeding from my mouth and now I’m missing a chunk of my front tooth. Like… an actual piece of my tooth is gone. So if anyone saw an older man biking the wrong way around that area last Thursday, please let me know. I just want him to take responsibility plus I shouldn’t have to pay for something that wasn’t my fault.
