Hi everyone,

i'm a dental hygiene student over at concorde career college located in San Bernardino. I'm currently looking for patients who are in need for a deep cleaning (if your last cleaning was +5 years ago)

The free services will include x-rays, oral cancer screening, local anesthesia/nitrous, fluoride &amp; polish, your cleaning, and anything needed for treatment. I have Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays available.

Since I am a student, appointments will need to be 3-4 visits and each are 4 hours long. Our learning environment indicates that all of our work is overseen by our instructors to ensure you are receiving the best care. I just ask for your time and patience.

I am currently looking for cases with moderate to heavy buildup.

Even a few people I recently met, who I thought I had good connections with, have started acting strange and seem to think they are somehow better than me.

I’ve taken some time to think about it, and I know I’m not the problem. I get along with people easily. I’m kind, friendly, and genuine. I treat everyone with respect, and I don’t go out of my way to create any kind of drama. But it’s clear that some people carry their own insecurities or hidden animosity, and that’s something I can’t control.

At this point, I’m learning to let people show who they really are. It hurts to realize that not everyone has good intentions, but I would rather know the truth than waste my energy on fake relationships.

My Calc 7A is not the only one with the wrong final exam date on the syllabus, it's the same for my Chem 1A class as well.

ucr,hot,🍊 Survey: How do UCR students learn about elections?,MapCzar,1,"Hi Highlanders!

I’m conducting a short, anonymous survey for a civic-tech project called **MapCzar** that looks at how students find and evaluate political information - especially around local elections.

The survey takes **under 5 minutes** to complete and asks about:

* How important different elections feel to you
* Where you get information on candidates
* How easy and trustworthy that information is

📋 [**Take the survey here**](https://forms.gle/qmgRfU4EkMjsF1nu6)

As a token of appreciation, respondents can opt into a **raffle for two $25 Amazon Gift Cards**.

Open to all UC Riverside students and faculty (especially those registered to vote in California)!
