Berkeley,top,Melt Banana is playing at Cornerstone on November 12th,joshhug,11,"Hello everyone, it's me, Josh Hug. I am not usually on this reddit, but it felt important to let you know that Melt Banana will be playing a show in Berkeley at Cornerstone on a Wednesday night.

As backstory, when I was 21, my roommate Jonathan was in a Japanese class, and his TA told them Melt Banana was playing a show and that they should go. Jonathan invited me along, so I fired up Kazaa or Limewire or whatever it was back then and downloaded a Melt Banana song and thought 'hmm, well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. Nonetheless, I went, and it was a very good show and I figured out how to like this music.

Since then, I have seen them at least 10 times. It may be a slight exaggeration, but Melt Banana is one of the few institutions that I truly believe in. Their most recent album 3 + 5 is their most listenable, though you will probably listen and think 'hmm well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. But really it's Rachmaninoff level (or better?) composing if you have the right ear for it.

If you are a fan of 100 gecs or King Gizzard, then perhaps you will like them.

Note that about a decade ago, they ditched their live drummer and bassist, so be warned that it's just Agata playing guitar and Yasuko doing her version of singing along with a drum machine.",1.0,0,11,1762929632.0,1,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Events/Organizations,1762928975.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/

Berkeley,top,A new Berkeley tradition....like no other,InternationalHour860,9,"Hello Berkeley community.  I’ve had this vision for Berkeley for years now, a fantastic new tradition combining the Big Game and honoring Cal-affiliated Nobel Prize laureates, and bringing in the greater Berkeley community in a days long celebration of science, academia and community.  

I’m not an alum, but I did grow in North Oakland and spent a lot of time on campus, I even sold the programs at the football games.  I went to high school in Berkeley, so I feel like I need to get this thought off my chest that has been there for a long freaking time.  Here is a quick summary.

Summary: 

Berkeley is one of the top producers of Nobel Laureates in the world, 2nd right now behind Harvard, and that is alumni and faculty.  (Different rankings with slightly different metrics have different positions but Cal is always top 5).   Stanford is in the top ten at a distant 6th.  So every other year when the Big Game is in Berkeley, there would be a halftime show honoring newly awarded laureates over the last two years, which has happened consistently for quite a while.  Splash the rankings on the big screen and rub it in Stanford’s face, creating another rivalry and a new time honored tradition like no other.  Crowd goes wild and sings ""Big C"".

Leading up to the Big Game, the city would hold Science Week, where kid and family friendly displays and activities related to economics and the sciences are set up festival style on campus and into the surrounding area, with open houses for the various labs, staffed by current students and local high school students(and who knows, maybe a Laureate who works there/went there happens by for a chat).  Prior and current Nobel Laureates who don't live locally would be flown in by Berkeley to participate in the festivities should they choose to attend.  On campus their would be seminars/roundtables with the Laureates and students in the respective departments.  They would be put up at The Claremont and have a formal dinner on Friday evening.  The next day is the Big Game, and the new laureates are honored.  Afterwords is more informal engagements ending in going to a bar with history and class(like Heinhold’s First and Last Chance) where the past Laureates honor the new ones with a round of “He/she’s a jolly good fellow”.  

So that’s the short summary.  I have hour by hour details and variables in my head but would take too long to write lol.  I don’t know anywhere else to post this so here it is.  Perhaps this is a stupid idea, but heck I think it would be a unique tradition that no other college town is doing, or can really do in the first place.  The Laureates deserve more than a free parking space, and so does the community and campus for fostering the environment that produces so many.   Maybe someone here knows people in high places to get this to or point me in the right direction, or maybe it sucks and the idea dies right here, right now……",0.76,0,9,False,3,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Local,1762924126.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/

Berkeley,top,"Berkeley, where would you rather eat? I built something for you.",TheShynola,0,"

Hi,  
I’ve mapped out Berkeley dining scene in an app I built called Vota. The idea is simple: you see two restaurants side by side, pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the smarter the list becomes. You can vote outside of Berkeley as well.

You could, for example, compare Chez Panisse with Sliver Pizzeria\* - completely different experiences, but over time, even very different places naturally find their true level in the ranking.

No fake reviews. No influencers. No ads. No AI-generated text. Just real votes from real people who actually eat here. No Tripadvisor noise, no Google clutter - only simple, honest comparisons.  
The app is free, doesn’t require registration, and collects no personal data.

Here’s the iPhone version:  
[https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212](https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212)

And here’s the Android version, which just went live  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)

It’s not perfect, bunch of P.S. I’m not studying at Berkeley (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, sell anything, or use AI content inside the app. However \*the restaurants above are just examples, chosen with a bit of AI help.

Berkeley,hot,"🔥 Urban Compassion Project’s  first-ever Berkeley cleanup! 🔥Volunteers and homeless neighbors teamed up to clear 24,000 pounds of dumping from 8th and Harrison, one of the city’s worst dumping hotspots. Energy was unreal! Berkeley, we will be back!",urbancompassionproj,230,"Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland. In that time, we’ve connected with more than 9,500 people living on the fringes, providing outreach and support with zero city funding.

This year alone, we’ve had over 1,900 volunteers come out to help us clear more than 600 tons of trash from over 50 sites across the Bay Area.

Our impact in Oakland has been huge, but we’re not stopping there. We’re expanding into new cities like Berkeley and beyond. With a growing network of over 3,000 volunteers, our model focuses on keeping areas clean while working directly with unhoused residents to get them the resources they need and ultimately to help them transition off the streets.

One of our most powerful initiatives is the Homeless Ambassador Program, which provides paid stipends to unhoused individuals to maintain clean areas. This approach creates ownership, opportunity, and dignity while building stronger community ties.

We’ve also worked hard to change the narrative about who’s responsible for illegal dumping. Many people wrongly assume unhoused residents are the main cause of dumping, but the truth is they’re often scapegoated while being the ones most impacted. We’ve documented countless cases of illegal commercial and residential dumping that target encampments simply because those living there have no voice.

About 75 percent of the areas we’ve cleaned remain clean, thanks to consistent monitoring and community collaboration. Urban Compassion Project is here for everyone in the community, housed or unhoused, and we’ll continue to step up where others won’t.

been seeing these creepy fliers for this AI dating app since last year, then 2 weeks ago dozens spammed all over every bus stop 

so i got curious and i found posts from other user saying: 

UCSD is getting spammed too 

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1oecjof/can_we_kill_ditto_ai_they_have_infected_this/

one of their devs basically admitted they got hacked and bots were used to spam the entire UCSD campus email system. he didn't say they got hacked, but i've never heard of bots sending spam emails over your custom email domain w/o your domain having been legit data breached / pwned... the emails came from their own email infrastructure, so... just connecting the dots

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1k0e0bt/ditto_ai_dittai/

a user claims Ditto's head of growth legally threatened them for posting negative feedback on their social media, and talking about their privacy policy 

here's the privacy policy btw... super sus!!!

&gt; ""We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences)""

&gt; ""despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information""

this one is weird, they literally use chatbot avatars mimicking users's profiles to converse with other users' chatbot avatars... these are legit using traits inferred by whatever (possibly biased) algorithms they run on you

&gt; ""We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you."" 


&gt; ""We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company""


their CEO literally said their head of marketing has a daytime job doing surgery at a bioengineering startup and then does ditto as their night job 

this really doesn't look like the next big thing, and the romanticized SFGate and KVTU coverage tries to make them sound almost heoric. 


but what's the reality? 

is ditto tone-deaf and aggressive on marketing, playing up being young, ambitious dropouts trying to disrupt modern dating - for hype? 


everything i found makes them look hellaaaa sus - especially using AI to reduce you into a commodity... what do their algorithms do on people who don't fit the mold? those are the people i want to hear from in the comments, cause my BIPOC friends who joined literally never heard anything after signing up, for months

so, what are these algorithms doing? ranking us, rating us, filtering us, matching us - based on what? how are black and brown folk doing? can a muslim meet another muslim on it? do short kings exist here?  how are users actually empowered rather than used? 

i have no data to back this up about ditto specifically, but this ain't exactly news:

Berkeley,hot,Can't Decide on Switching Majors from App. Math to Econ,jam751,3,"I am a first semester transfer student, Applied Math major, currently taking Math-110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) and Musa 74 (Math-55 was fulfilled for some reason). No prior proof experience.

I am currently doing pretty bad in Math-110. I got a 5/29 on the first midterm (mean was 13.5, std was 8.22) and got a 5/29 again on the second midterm (mean was 12.69, std was 7.75). I don't really care about gpa, I care about passing and learning the class/material, and my gpa would just reflect that.

I'm not interested in grad school. My main career choice is to be an actuary, but having to spend all of my time studying for an upper-division math class with abstract proof-writing (which I would most likely not have to ever see again in my line of work) instead of developing actual technical skills feels like such a waste of time.

As a result, my line of reasoning is that if I can switch to an easier major/subject which I still enjoy, relates to my line of work, and gives me more time, then I can make that switch and concentrate in developing said technical skills.

So, I chose Economics. I actually do enjoy the subject quite a bit, passed the AP Macro Exam with a 5 back in HS. After talking to an advisor, they've said it is possible to do the switch (not guaranteed tho) if I can just fulfill all the required courses by next semester and submit an appeal. So, I've enrolled in classes next semester that helps me fulfill those requirements.

I don't like to gamble all on one thing though, so I made a plan that if I do not end up switching over to Econ for whatever reason, I would still be on track to graduate on time with Applied Math (even if I fail/drop Math 110 this semester).

Some closing remarks, my performance in Math-110 has been very disheartening for me and it has left me wondering if I can really succeed in upper-div math. I'm definitely more than willing to redo the course if I fail/drop, but it makes me wonder, if there is an easier path to reach the same destination, why not take it?

And the only thing that's been holding me back from switching is the versatility that I hear so much about regarding a degree on Applied Math. Although I do want to be an actuary, I'm open and flexible to applying for other quantitative roles, and I am not sure if an Econ degree offers the same level of versatility and weight (I've heard....things about the job market/demand for Econ degrees). So, any input would be welcome, thank you!

**Tl;Dr:**

* I am a first semester transfer student majoring in Applied Math.  
* Currently taking Math 110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) w/ no prior proof experience and currently struggling (5/29 on both midterms, well below the average(stats specified above)).  
* I am not aiming for grad school; main career goal is to become an actuary.  
* I feel that spending excessive time on abstract proof-heavy math (irrelevant to field of work) is inefficient compared to developing technical/professional skills.  
* Currently considering switching to Economics, a subject I enjoy and find more relevant.
   * Advisor said it's possible if I complete the requirements by next semester and appeal.  
* Made a backup plan so I can still gradate on time with Applied Math even if I fail/drop Math 110  
* My main concern: whether switching to econ would limit my career flexibility or make me less competitive compared to staying in Applied Math?  

**Here's some questions I'd like to get answered if possible:**

1. How likely am I to pass Math 110 at this point?  
2. Does an Applied Math degree carry significant weight with employers (i.e. seen as rigorous or impressive)?  
3. How bad or competitive is the Economics job market, especially for quantitative or data-related roles?  
4. Would switching from Applied Math to Economics be a smart move considering my goals (actuarial career, employability, time efficiency)?

Berkeley,hot,Recent transplant from South Bay - what’s wrong with Berkeley?,Good-Adeptness8476,0,"I’ll start with traffic management. The city has just the right mixture of two-way and 4-way stops to keep everyone on their toes constantly. If you stop right behind the stop sign there is a fair to good chance you won’t see an incoming car due to all the cars parked curb side. Speaking of parking - there are practically no attached garages, or two-car garages anywhere, so all streets are filled with cars parked curb side. Parking enforcement vehicles swarm the town like hungry coyotes.

All medical clinics are severely understaffed. Social service is extremely bureaucratic, condescending and rude(I know this is the County, but still) . School district appears to be managed by agents of chaos - it’s really challenging to sort through all the paperwork to settle your kids into a school if you are a newcomer. And be prepared that your paperwork ends up on the wrong side of the event horizon. 

People are generally very nice and easy to approach, but on the internet they act like Goofy with “cyber-rage syndrome” - judgmental, sarcastic or otherwise unpleasant. Browse through NextDoor you’ll see. 

Even the garbage pickup is a nightmare to deal with. My yard waste bin disappeared on a pickup day once and didn’t get emptied twice. The pickup bill is outrageous expensive, even comparing to other (higher income) Bay Area counties.

ucla,top,How do I get a job at UCLA? It’s been so hard 😩,eviestar444,11,"
Hey everyone,
I’ve been trying to get a job at Santa Monica UCLA for a while now, but it’s honestly been really hard. I live in LA like there’s no way no phlebotomy or medical assistant jobs are hiring!!! I’ve applied to a bunch of positions (mostly clinical/front desk/patient-related jobs) through their career website, and other jobs as well but I never hear back. I’m certified in phlebotomy and soon to be a certified medical assistant, and I really want to work somewhere like UCLA Health since that’s also where I plan to transfer for nursing.

If anyone here works at UCLA Health or has gotten hired before, do you have any advice or tips? Like are there certain positions that are easier to get into first? Should I email HR or try to connect with someone who already works there? I really want to get my foot in the door but I’m starting to feel stuck.

Any tips or experiences would seriously help a lot 🙏

A bit about me. From Italy, I’m first gen and non-traditional student currently studying Spanish and Business Administration at Los Angeles City College. I’m also part of the UCLA CCCP program, and a part-time worker. I learned Spanish as a second language and I’m passionate about community and culture, which is why I chose this major.

If you have any advice on how to succeed in the Spanish program, like study tips, helpful professors, or what to expect from upper-division classes, I’d really appreciate it! Pleas
Thank you so much for your help!

Hi everyone! I've been looking through reddit posts and I see a recurring theme that taking chem6c and 7L will be very time consuming and difficult so I was wondering if anyone can give me advice on this schedule? It's going to be painfully physics and chem heavy which is why i'm really scared but it's kinda necessary for me to have to schedule these classes altogether. If I absolutely should switch out one of the chem courses, I could possibly do an upper-division bio like BIEB but I have a sliver of hope that I can handle these courses. As a background, i'm doing pretty decent in chem 6B (about a B grade) and i'm doing well in physics 1A/AL (I think I have at least a B+ or A-). I'm also a commuter who lives about 45mins away from campus so that's why I prefer stacking my classes to have T/TH free.

# How do I login to check my admissions decision?

You should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).

# How does the college I got matter? Can I change college? 

For freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.

Your major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (from Seventh to Eighth). 

You cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable.

UCSD,hot,rant and questions,GrilledGreenBean007,0,"Hi!

I am a first year at UCSD and things have not been going that well. Classes and profs are fine but I feel like I am missing out on something. The experience here for the past 1.5 months has not been what I thought it was going to be like at all, and has been somewhat traumatic and exhausting. The campus is ugly and depressing and there is no pretty building/traditional collegiate architecture. There are so many foreign students that it does not feel like an American university, it feels sometimes like I am in Asia and I don't like it (I just wish that there was just more culturally American people like myself here). There is no football team which is kind of depressing as even though I don't like football, the games and the vibes would be cool and make for fun memories/experiences (though I know that I choose this school knowing that there is no team here). I also feel like people don't really show up that much to other sports/there is a lack of school pride/cohesion/community/unification here. I am not a big sports person myself however I think in college it is fun to root for your school and participate in things like that if you know what I mean, and I feel like there is a lack of a unifying/unified thing/community here if that makes sense. I don't know, things just seem sort of dead.

I try to look on the bright side though and see how fortunate I am to be studying here and all  of the opportunities that the school provides from the education to the location (beach, Trader Joes, Ralph's, a theater, Barnes and Noble, World Market, CVS, Target) and clubs. This school has everything I need to thrive, though I just still feel like I am not thriving in it.

One thing I do love is how here I can just do my own thing and things aren't too competitive/cut-throat. At least with the people that I have met thus far and the places that I have been people want to more or less help each other succeed, as I know that at other colleges things are much more ""toxic"", cut-throat and competitive compared to here so I like the chill, layed backed attitudes/vibes that people have here.

Overall, I just don't know. Just the whole vibe and general demographic and look of the school was not at all what I thought it was going to be and I it makes me somewhat sad and feeling like I am missing out on a true college experience. There is just **something** missing. This place just seems a little empty/odd. Does anybody else feel that way or is it just me? And please don't say that I am not reaching out enough. I am not an anti-social person and have joined quite a few clubs/things looking for ""my people"", but they seem harder to come across than what I once thought. I am still reaching out to people, looking at new clubs to join to see which ones I want to stick to, and continue to go to classes and work hard on my studies.

I still have no true friends here (though I know that it is still pretty early on in the year) and just have some people that I know a little. Of course, my overall goal here is to get my degree and just have a good/happy, well-rounded and traditional college experience.

  
Does anyone else feel like they are missing out on something by being here? Have you been able to solve it? Is it just me? I am still trying to give UCSD a chance, but I am not sure if I will stick around for all 4 years. We will have to see.

UCSD,hot,take COGS 180 this Winter 2026!,drlucylai,144,"**hi everyone!**

i'm a new professor in COGS and am super excited to be offering **COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain** next quarter (Winter 2026) on ***T***u/Th ***at 3:30-4:50pm in FAH 1450.***

this course hasn't been offered in years, because the professor who created it left UCSD awhile ago. as a result, **i’ve completely redesigned COGS 180** to be an **interactive deep dive into the cognitive and neural processes that underlie human decision making.**

this **interdisciplinary course** blends ideas from psychology, neuroscience, economics, psychiatry, design, and ai. you’ll read and discuss research papers, give group presentations, and complete a project about some aspect of decision making that interests you.

in particular, we’ll cover:

* the psychology of everyday **cognitive biases**
* why it’s so hard to be **“rational""**
* the neuroscience of **how the brain handles uncertainty**
* how decision making is impaired in **psychiatric disorders**
* **computational models** of decision making
* how **ai** and **machine learning** can help us make better choices
* and so much more!

this class might be a great fit if you:

* want an **engaging, discussion-based** upper-div course (lectures will be podcasted but **participation** is worth a large chunk of your grade)
* want to understand more about why people make the choices they do
* want to sharpen your research and presentation skills

i am in the process of formally changing the prerequisites, so you are more than welcome to EASy request into it. **however, you should have some basic background in:**

* neuroscience / psychology concepts (e.g., COGS 17)
* statistics / probability / research methods
* be able to code in Python / MATLAB / R

more information, including **previous course evaluations and syllabi,** is available here: [**lucylai.com/teaching**](https://lucylai.com/teaching)

if you'd like to learn more about **me and/or my teaching philosophy,** go here: [**lucylai.com/ucsd**](http://lucylai.com/ucsd)

UCSD,hot,Its very likely I’m dropping out,EntertainmentAny4949,22,"(I would very much appreciate it if you read the whole thing before adding your rightful commentary)

I would consider the following a serious admission for how burdensome life has been for me lately; but I am now more convicted in the fact than ever, that this school is not really serving my interests anymore for what I thought I wanted for my own life, such that it’s now taken a very disparate piece of my own sanity and how I’ve been reacting to things, as well as how I’ve perceived external factors as well.

Being a transfer student, 8 hours away from home, arriving here from a place considered nowhere in CA (Modesto isn’t really the place to go for sensationalization) the matter of upgrading from a community college to the 3rd ranked Uni seemed like everything to me, and for a time, that’s all it was (Indeed, it was such an elitist mindset looking back). Granted, being a 3rd year for the first time here wasn’t the most convenient experience since even as an unapologetic extrovert, I had to work my ass off to get known, fall into a good space of people in regards to the clubs that served my interests at the time, and above all else, make sure I wasn’t a narcissist in such a competitive environment for, taking a step back and looking at it now, what I see as an unbearably uncertain and unpredictable job market, irrespective of whether you where even a post-grad student (it’s embarrassing to say, but only now, at 21, do I actually happen to have a legitimate job after all those years of unemployment, and hilariously enough, I like it a lot more than I do my own studies) 

But even so, with such privileged experiences, I’m afraid I can no longer make any breakthroughs in regards to my welfare in what I thought Political Science could do for me, to the extent that I no longer have any reason to want to see what it can bring me for the real world I’m gonna have to face. I will never admit that there wasn’t moments in my studies where I actually felt like I was in a legitimate state of scholarly rhythm, and I’ll even say, a sort of enthusiastic and passionate intersection between what I came to learn for real world topics when it came to readings and empirical articles alongside my own identity as a queer man. But I haven’t felt that way since I believe, winter quarter of 2025. These classes I have now, as it has been for a while with others, have fatigued and mentally burdened me to a very concerning degree, to the point where I had to reach out to the school’s services to prevent me from getting hurt amidst a really bad crisis I had earlier this month. I wholly believe if I continue for the sake of ego or pride, with the motive that I don’t desire to fail to obtain a degree that gives me a certain kind of status (because apparently thats more valued in this world than your actual autonomy as a person) I am gonna end up in a more dangerous spot than before, most likely towards irreversible damage, whatever that may look like. Before you even tell me to talk to resources like CAPS, or even visiting communities akin to my identity, know that I already have, and I’m just not satisfied, but rather disappointed to what I’ve seen (the referral process I was engaged in with CAPS back in Late February took from that point, to the literal beginning of April, all just to be out on a 3-5 week waitlist, so I gave up with that. I don’t doubt their providers are very helpful, but when a person like me, who’s already had a consistent history of therapy, with 4 different providers across different consistent basis’s dating all the way back to 2022, I believe there’s a threshold that’s crossed where a lack of therapy and coping skills for me to be articulate with my burdens is no longer the concern). 

Smaller burdens that came from me trying in communities include several inauthentic people I’ve met, who have conditionally befriended me on the basis of making sure they pass as well, and just fake folks all around for when I thought I could find people to engage in a loving relationship with intimacy wise, at least the ones I could scrap with such a socially dead school, even when you’re the shining example and not the outlier for these types of things. 

Right now I’m not in the best spot anywhere of me, so that’s all I can really muster up to say with such a considering opinion, but I want people to know that when such outliers like myself don’t exist; the isolation, the performance of status, the exhaustion from endless competition, the debt, and the loneliness of not fitting into dominant social molds, can actually help others live a better life than me, to which I hope they do, lord knows they need that status for whatever they chase. 
But over the painfully rigid machinery of higher education for what it often is: fast, expensive, alienating, and sometimes cruel in how little space it leaves for rest, healing, or authenticity, I’d much rather choose what’s left of my persons that I can consider “sane”. I don’t know what to do next, but I hope this long admission that I hope many have the patience in their literacy skills to read about (because I’m told a majority of new generations don’t read as lengthy as previous ones do anymore, which I hope is not true) makes anyone who doesn’t currently have the strength to talk about these types of burdens feel heard, seen, and above all else, un-isolated. I hope you’ve read through all this, for you are the true scholar.",0.7,0,22,False,32,True,False,False,self.UCSD,Discussion,1762815213.0,103795,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1otsr1p/its_very_likely_im_dropping_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1otsr1p/its_very_likely_im_dropping_out/

I was also planning to advertise it on Facebook marketplace, here on Reddit later on, on my instagram page, Etsy, YikYak (???), and ask my church if they knew anyone… 

I already have some of my rosaries sold at the old mission gift shop but they take 50% so I would preferably like to sell independently!

UCI,hot,Current &amp; Incoming 2029 Students FAQ Megathread,Aveldaheilt,50,"# Welcome, current and incoming 2029 Anteaters!

[*Zot zot zot!*](https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/a/2791/files/2015/09/anteater.png) As you may have long noticed (at the time of this writing), the season is ripe for admission decisions! The community has been welcoming new Anteaters most eager to embark on an exciting journey to *consume every last ant in SoCal!* *^(Just kidding... or am I?)*

This revived Megathread aims to (hopefully) provide succinct explanations and/or answers for the most commonly asked questions. Much like the previous megathread, this is also the place to discuss acceptances, ask questions, or answer questions about anything and everything about UCI! Lastly, if there is anything that you feel would be helpful in addition to the topics already addressed (or if something is erroneous), please don't be shy about leaving any comments, feedback, or suggestions!

# I got into UCI as [major/undeclared]. Can I change my major?

*Yes, you absolutely can!*

First, you'd want to have the [UCI General Catalogue](https://catalogue.uci.edu/) handy *^(Pssst! Bookmark it now!)*. The General Catalogue is updated each year and contains every single minor/major that UCI has to offer as well as the requirements needed to complete a degree/meet graduation. Some even provide sample study plans! This is where you'll also find the complete list of courses for the current year. If you are ever confused about the name or content of a class, you'll likely find your answer here.

Search for the major you are interested in to be sure that the courses, descriptions, and general path are something you really want. Next, check this [link](https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/) to see the Change of Major criteria for the major you want to switch into (categorised by school). If you wish to add a second or third major, it follows the same requirements as listed in the website above.

1. Consult with an academic counselor in your School first. They have access to your student profile and can help you determine whether a switch is possible as well as guide you in the process. I would also recommend visiting an academic counselor in the School of your prospective major.
2. Follow the requirements as listed in the Change of Major website.
3. After completing the necessary requirements, apply for a change of major under the ""Applications"" section of your StudentAccess account. This will be a place you'll visit often as your StudentAccess account has other information such as your unofficial transcript, a GPA calculator, and so on. Here is a [link](https://reg.uci.edu/) to where you'd find this. You'll be visiting the linked site often when you're a student as it is the portal to registering for classes and has other helpful information such as the current Schedule of Classes.
4. If approved, you'll see it reflected under the Applications tab and in your DegreeWorks. Here is an [example](https://i.imgur.com/pMcvBS5.png) for a double major. *(Note that both majors were kept in this instance—otherwise, one major would have a red minus sign to the right of ""Approved"" indicating a drop.)*

**Note:** If you are an incoming freshman, I would *not* stress over needing to change your major immediately. You will be spending a large duration of your time during the first two years at UCI completing your General Education requirements rather than taking courses specific to a major. That's not to say you can't work towards completing the criteria you need to change your major (and many GE classes do count towards lower-division major requirements as well). However, it does not need to be an immediate thing—and in most cases, cannot be an immediate thing as it may take a few quarters of taking classes in order to meet a Change of Major criteria.

# Can I change my major to Computer Science?

*Yes, you can!*

However, note that it'll be something that many others will be looking to do as well. **If you are a transfer outside of the School of ICS, this may not be possible.** I would speak with an academic counselor first. Changing your major to Computer Science follows much of the same process for any other major, with a few caveats.

The School of ICS, which hosts majors such as Computer Science, Data Science, and Informatics, is *extremely impacted!* This means that if you were not accepted as an ICS student, you may have a difficult time swapping in because everyone will be trying to get into ICS 31 and students already under the School will have priority registration. ICS 31 to ICS 33 is a one-year track of Python programming that almost every major under the School of ICS needs to graduate. So you'd essentially be competing with students who need the course for their degree as well as prospective students looking to swap in (you'll need to complete the entire series to switch). That's not saying it's entirely impossible to get in, but you'd have to keep a close eye on the class as there is no waitlist as well. And if you find yourself really struggling to get in, there are other options to consider:

1. Take the course during the summer ten-week session. Note that if you receive financial aid during the standard school year, it does not apply towards summer sessions. You will have to look into summer-specific financial aid options, or pay out of pocket.
2. [Test out of](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/undergrad/ics-credit-by-exam/) ICS 31 and into ICS 32 if you already have some CS knowledge. ICS 32 should be a little easier to enroll in as it is the second class out of the three course series. **Note: Applies only to students already under the School of ICS.**
3. Take the equivalent of the courses at a Community College. You can attend both UCI and a CC at the same time, but I'd check with a counselor first. If you wish to do this, I'd recommend Orange Coast College as the counselors in ICS seem to really like that CC and the courses from there. You'd run into far less problems during the articulation process of receiving credit for a class completion outside of UCI.

For those with AP Computer Science exam scores:

* If you scored between 1-2 or took AP Computer Science Principles, you will still need to take ICS 31.
* If you scored between 3-5, you can choose to take the exam for credit or directly enroll in ICS H32. ICS 32 and ICS H32 are practically the same, except that ICS H32 includes a quick crash course on Python at the beginning of the quarter. *(Updated from ICS 32A → ICS H32, thank you /u/YAK_awesome!)*

Note the exam ***only*** gives course credit for ICS 31.

# Can I double major?

*Yes*. Double majoring follows the exact same process as changing your major. However, there are several considerations if this is something you may be looking to do:

1. UCI's majors belong to different ""Schools."" For example, Philosophy is under the School of Humanities and Political Science is under the School of Social Sciences. Some Schools have their own set of requirements *in addition* to the courses already needed for your degree. Be sure to look into this if you are planning your schedule.
2. A second major will likely require you to stay an extra year, especially if you are doing two majors in two different Schools. So those who were admitted as freshman may be looking at five years total and those admitted as transfers would be looking at three years total.
3. If you receive financial aid, you will need to be careful about ""completing"" one major before the other as you will risk financial aid cut-off. The workaround to this is to schedule your classes in such a way so that you complete both your majors at the same time in the quarter before your graduation. In other words, leaving one or two classes in both majors for last.

And as always, consult an academic counselor before making any important decisions.

# How do I add a minor?

Adding a minor is a fairly simple procedure.

1. Take the courses listed under the requirements tab for the minor you're interested in. (Don't forget you can find this in the UCI Course Catalogue!) Typically, minors are six to seven courses.
2. Make an appointment or walk-in to see an academic counselor. They will add the minor to your DegreeWorks. You can also do this at any time, even before you start taking any classes towards your minor. **I'd actually recommend doing this ASAP as your personal DegreeWorks will list all the courses you'll need to complete it.** DegreeWorks is a basically an actively updated page with a complete rundown of your academic career at UCI—such as classes you've taken, your GPA, units, etc.
3. Complete your minor before graduation to receive credit for it. You will see [a checkmark](https://i.imgur.com/8clcQQE.png) under the graduation application page if you do. Minors are only credited in your official transcript and nowhere else.

To remove or change minors at any time, simply revisit an academic counselor. It's a pretty casual process. However, keep in mind that adding a minor **does not grant you priority in registration for classes if your major does not fall under the same School as your minor!** Most classes are restricted for the first few weeks during registration windows for students in that School and only open up to all UCI students much later on *(some classes also remain completely restricted to certain Schools)*.

* **Note:** If you are looking to do an ICS minor, you may run into trouble getting the classes you need due to how impacted the School is.

# Do my AP credits transfer over?

*Yes, they do.* Please refer to this [website](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/ap-exam-credits/ap-credits/irvine.html) for the full list of AP credits that UCI accepts.

# Where do I find the current quarter's Schedule of Classes?

Welcome to [WebReg](https://reg.uci.edu/)! Please look forward to a most pleasant and lovely time with your new best friend. WebReg serves as the main portal to a number of important things you'll be doing during your time as a student at UCI. It is the place to register for classes, apply for graduation, view your Unofficial Transcript, change or add a major, and much more. Over the years, you'll be visiting this place often. *Very,* ***very*** *often.*

*New best friend?* New best friend.

The Schedule of Classes *(and our other best friend, the UCI General Catalogue)* can be found in the main navigational tabs.

# Wait, there are entire lists of prospective courses being offered for the year?

Most Schools aim to release a full list of undergraduate courses for the next academic year by the sixth week of Spring Quarter. For your convenience, I've linked each School's below (at least the ones I could find):

* School of Biological Sciences: [Link](https://undergraduate.bio.uci.edu/course-offerings/)
* School of Business: [Link](https://merage.uci.edu/_files/documents/programs/undergraduate/22-23-Tentative-MGMT-Schedule-3.pdf)
* School of Education: [Link](https://advise.education.uci.edu/tentative-course-schedule.html)
* School of Engineering: [Link](https://undergraduate.eng.uci.edu/advising/course-planning/)
* School of Humanities: [Link](https://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/academics/planned)
* School of ICS: [Link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/courses/index-course)
* School of Social Ecology:  [Link](https://students.soceco.uci.edu/)
* Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences: [Link](https://pharmsci.uci.edu/course-scheduling-information/)

If you cannot find your School or major as listed above, try to do a quick search with \[your major\] + \[your major's school\] + ""UCI undergraduate course listing."" *(e.g. Urban Studies School of Social Ecology UCI undergraduate course listing.)* Some majors are handled by specific departments within the School and can only release course listings for that major rather than for all majors under the School. Others have no listing at all so if you can't find yours, there probably wasn't one created or made publicly available.

# Should I major in Computer Science, Data Science, or Software Engineering?

**Disclaimer: UCI is the** ***ONLY*** **UC where Computer Science is** ***NOT*** **under the same department as Engineering! It is in its own School (Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences) alongside Software Engineering and Data Science.** ^(Well, CSE technically exists, but that's a story for another day.)

*Wait, what does that even mean?* Well, it means that the three majors mentioned above (and other majors within the School such as Informatics) take many of the same lower-division/core classes. In fact, the only difference between the lower-divisions needed for Computer Science and Software Engineering is a single class (ICS 53).

This also means that *all three majors* require completion of two key classes that cover fundamental topics necessary for anyone learning Computer Science—and for successful (whiteboard) tech interviews *(see: LeetCode grind)*:

* ICS 46: Data Structure Implementation and Analysis
* CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

So if you were accepted for Data Science or Software Engineering, and are worried about being properly equipped with the knowledge to enter the tech field after graduation, know that you'll still be receiving almost exactly the same fundamental education as a CS major would. (And ultimately, the amount of personal projects and effort you put into preparing for tech interviews matter far more than the title of the degree.)

Regarding [Data Science](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofstatistics/datascience_bs/#requirementstext): A large portion of this major consists of taking classes in Statistics. If you're a lover of Statistics, you'll feel right at home. There are also plenty of solid CS electives to choose from—ranging from topics in AI to database management.

Regarding [Software Engineering](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/softwareengineering_bs/#requirementstext): Software Engineering as offered at UCI is basically a specialised track/rigid version of the Computer Science major. This is because a [Computer Science](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#requirementstext) major can in fact take every class required and offered in Software Engineering for credit. However, the reverse is not true, making it impractical for someone already majoring in CS to switch to Software Engineering.

A large portion of this major consists of taking core classes in IN4MTX. Some classes are extremely useful for the industry (debugging, AGILE, design patterns/refactoring, etc.) while others not so much. But given that we are edging towards opinion territory and that this thread's main purpose is to serve as a general FAQ—if you'd like to know more, don't be shy about reaching out or leaving a comment below!

# What are lower-division and upper-division classes?

Lower-division classes are:

* Labeled by a number between \[1-99\]. *(e.g. FMS 85C)*
* Often considered classes that teach core/fundamental concepts for a major. (*e.g. ICS 31-33, a one-year track of Python programming for all ICS majors)*
* Generally larger-sized classes (some have a max capacity of 300 students) as these classes are usually taken by students across every major to complete GE requirements.
* All GEs are lower-division.

Upper-division classes are:

* Labeled by a number between \[100-199\]. *(e.g. PHILOS 110)*
* Often considered classes that are more specialised/tailored to a major. *(e.g. C144, Criminal Law, a class that would count for upper-division elective credit towards the major Criminology, Law, &amp; Society)*
* Generally smaller-sized classes as these classes are usually only taken by those within the major or those looking to complete a minor.
* Most major electives are upper-division.

# How do I join an organisation? Frats? Clubs?

The full list can be found [here](https://campusorgs.uci.edu/). At the very top of the site, click ""Search Campus Organisations"" to look for organisations you may be interested in. This website serves as the main hub for all UCI Campus Organisations—including professional organisations, frats, cultural clubs, and so on. If you're interested in creating or registering your own organisation, it'll have all the information you'll need.

Every new academic year, an event called the ""Anteater Involvement Fair"" is held during week zero of Fall Quarter. On this special day, nearly every organisation will set up their own booth in the hopes of attracting new members. It's tons of fun and I highly recommend checking it out even if you're not particularly looking to join anything. *Who knows, there might be something among the 600+ organisations just for you...*

# Swagman?

The man, the myth, the legend. No one knows who he is or where he comes from. Some say a Swagman sighting grants you good luck...so be sure to keep your eyes peeled! *^(Especially during finals week!)*

# Petr drops?

If you ever see a large crowd of people madly dashing across campus in a single direction, it probably means a Petr drop was announced.

Petr drops are an experience purely unique to UCI. After popping up around late 2018, Petr drops have firmly rooted itself as a tradition to our school as new Petrs take up the mantle of those who have graduated before. Further explanation on its origins by one of the original Petrs is linked [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnlExXhx7F/). Also see /u/YummySpamMusubi's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/12fcv7y/comment/jff06sq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for more information and a history on Petr drops!

# Activities to do in the area?

~~Sometimes I imagine leaving my room.~~ *~~Oh, the absolute horror!~~*

UCI is:

* Just a ten minute drive from the western coastline, meaning *tons of beaches!* My personal recommendation is [Treasure Island](https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/things-to-do/beaches/treasure-island/) in Laguna Beach. Nice and clean with absolutely stunning views. *^(Even had a cousin)* *^(take their wedding photos here!)*
* Pretty darn crazy about boba! Irvine has a serious abundance of boba shops. I swear a new one pops up every other month. And if you enjoy discovering new food, Orange County has plenty to offer!
* Within a reasonable driving distance of three amusement parks: Disneyland (Anaheim), Knott's Berry Farm (Buena Park), and Universal Studios (Hollywood).
* A beautiful campus with a lush and relaxing park in the center of it all. Catch a break from classes with a picnic or bring your very own hammock!
* Also in one of the safest cities in the United States! Of course, nothing and nowhere is *completely* safe, but it's made late night studying and hangouts much more comfortable compared to... being in downtown LA, for instance. *^(Not throwing shade at a certain other UC, I promise!)*

As you may have inferred by now, having a car is a rather beneficial thing during your time at UCI... *^(except perhaps having to pay upwards of $600 a year to park, ugh)*. But high chances are that any organisations and/or events you attend will be arranging rides for those without personal means of transportation. Prior to CoVID, you could also (for a small fee) takes busses to large shopping areas such as The Irvine Spectrum or The District in Tustin. There were even stops for Diamond Jamboree, a plaza near campus with an H-Mart and a wide variety of Asian restaurants. While nothing has been officially confirmed as of yet, I hear there may be talk of reinstating these lines in the near future. ^(Or, you know, you could always leech off a friend, heh. Just be sure to return the favour with the occasional meal! Or gas money. Or a gigantic serving of ants.)

# Some cool fun facts?

I gotcha. Did you know:

* [In N Out's headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger) can be seen from the main drop-off/pick-up area on campus (called ""the flagpoles"" by many students).
* [Multiple movies](https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~rdalton/movies/ucimovies.htm) have been filmed at or near UCI, including *Ocean's Eleven (2001)*, *Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)*, *Poltergeist (1982)*, and *Unfrosted (2024)*.
* Conan O'Brien [has visited us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eobtp2G7d7o)!
* President Obama (at the time) [gave a commencement speech](https://time.com/4341811/obama-commencement-speech-transcript-university-of-california-irvine/) during UCI's 50th anniversary.
* We have no football team. *Why is that?* Well, because we chose to [build a science library](https://newuniversity.org/2009/11/23/the-debate-on-football-at-uci-2/) instead! Rumours say that the architects of the library were die-hard *Star Trek* fans and [modeled the building after the USS Enterprise](https://newuniversity.org/2017/02/28/life-on-ring-road-the-allure-of-ayala/).
* UCI is one of the only universities to have their very own [eSports Arena (PC Bang)](https://esports.uci.edu/arena/) on campus. Scholarships are offered for those on the *League of Legends* or *Overwatch* varsity teams. *(Not to mention, the amount of notable figures in the LoL community that have attended UCI over the years!)*
* R.I.P. Kobe Bryant. He was known [to frequent UCI's gym](https://ucirvinesports.com/news/2020/8/24/general-kobeday-remembering-kobe-bryant), the ARC (Anteater Recreation Center). *(Check it out when/if you're a student. After all, it's included as part of the tuition fees you pay every quarter!)* Kobe joined pick-up games, inspired both fans and aspiring athletes alike, and left everyone who was lucky enough to meet him with an amazing and wholesome experience.

UCI,hot,How to request assistance in a time of crisis while attending college (Student Emergency Tools),JulieMarlin,369,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I created a Discord server for communication and knowledge sharing on the same topic ([https://discord.gg/6NhfgxJzGD](https://discord.gg/6NhfgxJzGD)).

&amp;#x200B;

This post was inspired by a recent conversation on reddit with an UCI student who was experiencing a crisis and did not know how to ask for financial assistance and basic needs. While there are numerous resources available at UCI and elsewhere to assist students in times of need, I found that many students are unaware of their existence, and there is no all-in-one reference on the subject. As a student who had experienced the same condition, I felt obligated to share this information with my UCI sisters and brothers in order to repay the university for the great things it had done for me. These resources are free and were collected from my five years of personal experience; I have no affiliation with any of them. Other resources and supports are available beside what I share, but these are the ones that worked quickly for me in times of emergency, based on my own personal experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

***UCI Emergency Support***

**UCI Basic Needs** ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/)) is a UCI-funded department that assists students in **times of crisis**. They have numerous resources to assist students at all levels of education, including **undergraduate and graduate**. Their services are accessible to **both citizens and non-citizens**, and they are the best resource for emergency assistance. To qualify for their services, you must schedule a meeting ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/services/financial-wellness-consultations.php)), and submit supporting documentation. If you qualify, a campus social worker will coordinate with other departments to resolve your issue as your case manager. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* UCI Food Pantry and Free Food ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/food-pantry.php))
* CalFresh Application Assistance
* Emergency Meal Swipes
* Campus Social Worker Consultations
* Economic Crisis Response Grant
* Financial Wellness Consultations
* Emergency Store Gift Cards
* 30-days of temporary housing
* Diaper Bank
* Grocery Card Support
* Short-Term Transportation Support
* Life Skills Workshops
* Hygiene
* Coordination with other departments for your emergency protection

**Requirements:** provide documents to support your emergency crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

***State Emergency Support***

**State of California** resources are not restricted to students, but are available to all State of California **Citizens** and **Permanent Residents** (Green Card). You must submit an application on their website ([link](https://www.mybenefitscalwin.org/)) along with supporting documentation. A state social worker will contact you in two weeks for an interview and verification. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* **Food** assistance up to **$250** per month. (**CalFresh**)
* **Medical insurance** assistance. (**Medicaid**)
* **Emergency Cash** assistance up to **$400** per month. (**General Relief**)

**Requirements:** US citizen, California resident, and income less than $1,200.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Legal Emergency Support***

**The Public Law Center, Orange County's pro bono law firm**, is committed to providing **free** access to justice for low income residents. Through volunteers and staff, the Public Law Center provides free civil legal services, including **counseling**, **individual** **representation**, **community** **education**, and **strategic** **litigation** and **advocacy to challenge societal injustices.** Now in its 39th year of service, PLC works with nearly 1,500 volunteer lawyers, paralegals, law students, and others from throughout the county who volunteer their time and expertise ([link](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/flyer-for-outreach-what-plc-does-english-2020.pdf)).

**Requirements:** everyone with a legal issue qualifies.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Legal Emergency Support***

**Legal Aid Society** ([link](https://www.communitylegalsocal.org/)) is a state-funded organization with 40 Attorneys, 120 Staff Members, and 4 Locations offering Legal Services. You are **not required to pay** for any of the provided services. Their services include the following, but are not limited to:

* Evaluation, Advice, and Counsel
* Clinics, Workshops, and Self-Help Centers
* Direct Representation
* Impact Litigation
* Policy Advocacy

**Requirements:** everyone with a legal issue qualifies.

&amp;#x200B;

***Mental Health Emergency Support***

Despite the importance of **Mental Health** in college life, many students do not consider it. Students are handed over with numerous conditions that each add a distinct mental pressure. Mental health is essential because most people do not recognize their symptoms until it is too late, after they have caused numerous problems for themselves and society. The **UCI Counseling Center** ([link](https://counseling.uci.edu/)) offers 24-hour, **no-cost counseling services**. You can contact them if coursework or personal pressure that you cannot manage is affecting your mental health or judgment, and they will provide you with services such as a referral to drop the quarter. If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition, it is wise to request supporting documentation and **keep a record** of it, even if your condition is not currently interfering with your schedule, because the documentation could be useful **in the future** if you miss an exam or homework due to your condition.

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&amp;#x200B;

***Medical Emergency Support***

As long as you provide a referral document from the **UCI Student Health Center** ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/)) or any other medical facility or emergency rooms and pay the co-payment ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/UC%20SHIP%20Irvine%20SBC%202021-22%204132021_0.pdf)), the majority of Medical Costs are covered by **UCSHIP**. If you need to communicate with the insurance department or nurses, you can use the **health center's portal**, which is the most secure method, and they typically respond the same day.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for UCSHIP medical insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

***Affordable Medical Emergency Support***

If you do not have **UCSHIP**, **SOS** ([link](https://www.shareourselves.org/)) provides low-cost medical services and accepts **Medical**. To schedule a meeting with your assigned case manager, you must **contact their phone number**. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Coverage Programs
* Medical Services
* Dental Services
* Women’s Health
* OB Program
* Children’s Services
* Behavioral Health
* Pharmacy Services
* Health Education

**Requirements:** everyone with a medical issue qualifies.

***Dental Emergency Support***

In the event of a **dental emergency**, school insurance will cover a portion of the costs ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/131943A_EOC_UCSHIP_v3_remediated_Final.pdf)), but you must schedule an appointment at the UCI Dental Clinic ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/services/dental-services)), where they will refer you to a dentist or oral surgeon following an examination. If you do not have sufficient funds, you can request that the provider apply for **Care Credit**, a program that checks your credit and lends you money for dental repair.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for Delta dental insurance..

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Dental Emergency***

The Omid Institute ([link](https://www.omidinstitute.org/)) offers Dental Services for free or at a low cost. You must complete a form on their website and schedule a meeting with your case manager. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Education
* Hygiene

**Requirements:** everyone with a dental issue qualifies.

&amp;#x200B;

***Disability Emergency Support***

The **UCI Disability Services Center** ([link](https://dsc.uci.edu/)) provides services to students with **temporary or permanent disabilities**. If you have **ADHD**, **PTSD**, a B**one Fracture**, or **any other disability** that hinders your college life, **DSC** will assist you in creating an equal environment. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Ring Road Rides is a service provided to students with mobility limitations to help get to and from classes
* Assistive technology (AT)
* Alternate Instructional Material Services
* Note-taking resources
* Wellness Health &amp; Counseling Services
* Extra exam time
* A separate setting for examinations

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad), meeting with a disability advocate, supporting documents.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Emergency Road Assistant***

UCI Transportation and Distribution Services ([link](https://parking.uci.edu/services/campus/vips.cfm)) is provided on the main campus at no charge to all UCI affiliates and includes a Motorist Assist, Bike Assist and Emergency Ride Home Program.

Motorist Assist

* Jumpstart

* Vehicle unlock
* Emergency Gas Delivery
* Mobile EV Charging

Bike Assist

* Tire sealant
* Tire inflation

Emergency Ride Home Service

* One-way ride within a 40 mile radius of UCI

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&amp;#x200B;

***Coursework Emergency***

To raise your concern about **grades and courses** you need to contact your **department**. Contrary to popular belief, **email communication with administration or professors is typically ignored** for many reasons especially after the quarter has ended. Schedule a **remote meeting** with the department, and they will assign you an **advocate (advisor)** to follow up on your concern and negotiate with the professors. The same rule applies to the dean, in which all academic advisors report daily to the dean and seek assistance from the dean when they are unable to resolve issues with professors. For the same reason, the dean is not directly concerned with student matters.

&amp;#x200B;

***Academic Probation Support***

The best way to get off **academic probation** is to schedule an appointment with a department advisor and then **enroll in easy general courses** for the following quarter. It may alter the plan you had in mind, but it prevents you from being disqualified, as academic probation is **removed** if the requirements are met the following quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

***Communication Emergency***

If you cannot afford a **phone or the monthly fee**, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provides eligible individuals with a free phone line and mobile device (Lifeline). If you are currently receiving **CalFresh**, which indicates a low income condition, you have met the requirements. The line and device are free for one year, and will be renewed annually if the requirements are met. To receive the line and device, you must submit an application to a phone carrier. The **Assurance Wireless** ([link](https://www.assurancewireless.com/)) is one of the providers for which you can submit an online application on their website; if approved, you will receive a phone device within two weeks. You are not eligible for a second phone for one year, as each line is associated with a single individual and includes **6 GB of internet and unlimited calls and texts monthly**.

**Requirements:** Receiving CalFresh.

&amp;#x200B;

***Unauthorized Transaction and Identity Theft Emergency***

If you discover an **unauthorized charge** on your bank account or an **unauthorized credit inquiry**, you must notify the **state police** and retain a copy of the **police report**. Then you must contact your bank and dispute the transaction. In the event of an unauthorized credit pull, you must send a letter along with a police report to the **credit bureaus** (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) requesting that they remove the inquiry. Each year, you can monitor your credit for free on AnnualCreditReport ([link](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action)).

&amp;#x200B;

***Computer Emergency***

Since some majors require you to have a personal computer, you can borrow a laptop from the library ([link](https://www.lib.uci.edu/mrc/mrc-laptops-and-mobile-devices)) for 48 hours if you lose access to a computer and cannot afford to purchase one immediately. Some departments (ICS) offer two-week laptop loan periods ([link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/Laptop_ComputerUse)). In addition, if you are already registered with Basic Needs and receive grants and financial aid, you can contact financial aid ([link](https://www.ofas.uci.edu/)) to increase the budget for the purchase of a personal computer. In some instances, financial aid has made this option available.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free CSO Escort Services***

The **UC Irvine Police Department** ([link](https://www.police.uci.edu)) offers the CSO Safety Escort program, a **free service to members** of the community. The objective of the program is to provide a safe alternative to walking alone at night.

&amp;#x200B;

***Free Tax Preparation***

MyFreeTaxes ([link](https://myfreetaxes.com/)) provides ""low-income"" taxpayers with free tax preparation services. This value fluctuates annually, but the majority of students fall into this category. There are two different ways to utilize this service. You can do this online using the H&amp;R Block software provided. Alternately, there are locations in Orange County where you can receive tax preparation assistance from an IRS Volunteer. Appointment is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

***Emotional Animal Support***

If you are interested in adopting a pet for emotional support, one of the legitimate places to do so is [Irvine Animal Care Center](https://www.cityofirvine.org/irvine-animal-care-center). They require a small donation when adopting a pet, but since they are affiliated with the City of Irvine, you can negotiate a reduced or waived adoption fee if you are a student. They can be reached via both email and telephone. After adopting a pet, you are required to notify your landlord and pay an additional deposit. However, if you are adopting a pet for emotional support, you can request a letter of support from the UCI Counseling Center or any psychiatrist to waive the additional deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

***Campus Assist List***

The Campus Assist List is an online collection of campus and community resources for low-cost community services, including basic needs, medical, and local mental health and counseling providers. Some are the ones I've shared here, while others are not. Since this is on the UCI website, I decided to add it to the list, although I have only personal experience with the ones I've included. ([link](https://help.uci.edu)).

&amp;#x200B;

***UCI Clubs***

List of UCI clubs and groups where like-minded students can be found ([link](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/club_signup?group_type=33373&amp;category_tags=)).

&amp;#x200B;

***Other fellow students' recommendations and suggestions***

* /u/throwaway_fctg, /u/foreignfishes, /u/anthrostudentuci and /u/JWOINK  have provided good suggestion regarding financial and food emergency assistance ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/waxt4u/what_do_i_do_im_basically_broke_and_disowned/)).

* u/Relative-Clue9995 has written a wonderful post on Monkeypox ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/wg3gor/monkeypox_uci/)).


* u/lordswaggggggg received a financial aid offer to purchase a laptop, and /u/BrntStrdl shared her experience in a remarkable comment ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/wjuq9b/extra_2k_for_laptop_has_anyone_gotten_the_offer/)).

* u/NatAllMentIll/ has shared the contact number and information about NAMI regarding of mental health ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/w8rmvh/need_to_vent_confidential_247_emotional_support/)).

UCI,hot,someone tell me it’ll get better,fried_ant,50,"hi, i feel like im going insane right now

im living with a roommate who will leave moldy food in the fridge, keep food uncovered for weeks in the fridge, and leave rotting/molding produce outside on the counter for weeks.

I’ve asked them multiple times to cover their food and that their food is molding, but nothing changes.

now there are a bunch of fruit flies in the kitchen. I can’t open the fridge without gagging/vomiting. I can’t eat in the kitchen or wash dishes without being assaulted by flies (which im trying to get rid of —but even though I kill so many, it’s like they never end—because a bunch of them suddenly appeared the day after my roommate finally discarded the rotting produce that was on the counter—I don’t know if it was discarded in the actual dumpster or if they threw them in their personal trash can..). There are days where I just don’t eat because I’m so disgusted/overwhelmed at the state of things.

I feel so disgusted and it’s stressing me out and making me anxious. There are days I get so overwhelmed I can’t stop myself from crying. I feel so dirty and I’m trying to make a clean space but it’s so hard when the person you’re living with isn’t cooperating.

I talked to my CA about this and they’re trying to have a meeting with my roommate now, but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. I really don’t. I have exams this week and I’m stressing out because I can’t focus.

I really really really want to move out, but based on what I’ve gathered, it looks hard. Does anyone know the process and if I’ll even have a shot at swapping room assignment? (For ACC apartments)

And I’d really appreciate some words of comfort 😣 I feel really hopeless.

I have to look fondly from inside my enclosure at my family from our homeland graduating with MDs at a young age, their bodies unwasted, their souls untainted by the fucking buffoonery required by the AAMC. 

And then these schools wonder how they produce culturally incompetent, socially inept, ethically monstrous “doctors”. YOU MAKE IT SO THAT ABSOLUTELY NO ONE BUT THE RICHEST AND MOST SOCIOPATHIC PEOPLE ON THE PLANET CAN BE DOCTORS. You bitches create a system of forced labor, from high school all the way through residency, making people donate time they don’t have to causes they don’t care about, year after year, to prove they want to be doctors. Its insane.

UCI,hot,Question about Masters of Computer Science at UCI,Sevalex7,3,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking into doing grad school at UCI next year. Currently, I'm finishing up my undergrad as a CS major at a different university. 

I've heard of two different masters programs for CS at UCI: ""Masters of CS"" and ""Masters of Science CS"". The former looks a lot more appealing to me because of all the industry work that it offers, but I saw another Reddit post from a few years ago where someone said that the professional ""Masters of CS"" program is for people who are already employed and would like to complete a Masters degree while working full-time. 

I couldn't find any official UCI site stating this, but I'm worried that I may not be the target candidate for the Masters of CS program (since I don't have employment for next year), and that maybe I'd be better off applying to the more academic ""Masters of Science CS"" program. Can anyone confirm if the more professional ""Masters of CS"" program is catered towards people who are currently working, and if I should apply to the ""Masters of Science CS"" program instead?",1.0,0,3,False,2,True,False,False,self.UCI,,1762755776.0,59154,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1ot6ies/question_about_masters_of_computer_science_at_uci/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1ot6ies/question_about_masters_of_computer_science_at_uci/

UCI,hot,WHY STRIKE?!?!?!,Double-Snow4551,88,"Hey everybody

It seems like in my last post, some people didn’t fully understand the point of the strike, but that doesn’t make it unnecessary.

One thing we will **never do** is undermine the stories and realities of workers, when the truth isn’t pretty. And no, many students **can’t just quit and find a new job**,  that’s not how life works. Students shouldn’t have to quit because of **unfair treatment or workplace abuse**.

If you have questions or want a better understanding, leave a comment and I’ll provide more information.

Another thing: we will **never call any UCI worker a name**. Every worker here deserves the **utmost respect**, especially full-time staff.

Just because that’s **how the system is set up** doesn’t make it fair. Saying “that’s just how life is” is basically saying you’re okay with confining yourself to an **unfair system** instead of doing anything to fix it. Fairness and change don’t happen by accepting the status quo, they happen when people **speak up and take action**. 

**WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE STRIKE?**

* Getting a fair contract — these unions represent service workers, patient‑care technical staff, and research/technical professionals who say their contracts have expired and negotiations have dragged on. [Daily Bruin+2AFSCME 3299+2](https://dailybruin.com/2025/11/06/upte-cwa-9119-afscme-local-3299-to-strike-nov-17-18-backed-by-cna/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Addressing cost‑of‑living &amp; affordability crises: real wages for many of these workers have declined, while housing and other living expenses have shot up. [AFSCME 3299+1](https://afscme3299.org/media/release-65000-university-of-california-campus-and-health-center-workers-will-strike-statewide-on-nov-17th-and-18th/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Better staffing &amp; working conditions: They say understaffing is worsening, which affects research, patient care, service operations, and student support.



**WHY IT MATTERS?**

* Its affecting *YOU*
* The scale: More than **65,000–86,000** UC employees across campuses and medical centers are involved. [AFSCME 3299+1](https://afscme3299.org/media/release-65000-university-of-california-campus-and-health-center-workers-will-strike-statewide-on-nov-17th-and-18th/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* The unions claim the university has been spending large sums (for example on facilities, executive compensation) but hasn’t matched that with living‑wage support or improved conditions for large numbers of frontline workers. 

**STAND WITH WORKERS. STAND FOR FAIRNESS. STAND TOGETHER.**

**JOIN THE STRIKE!**

**STUDENT WORKERS -** this is your time to stand in solidarity!

You have the right to join the strike and show that both dining *halls can’t run without you.*

Your work matters, your effort matters, AND your voices matter. **YOU MATTER!**

**SO,** if you can **CALL OUT AND JOIN THE STRIKE**

Let’s stand together with the full-time staff and demand better conditions and fair treatment for **EVERYONE**

**STUDENTS-** we need you!

Even if you don't work in dining, you can still make a difference!

Come at the the dining hall bring ALL YOUR FRIENDS, APPLY pressure by SHOWING UP

**WHY?**

* Because you already paid for your dining pass (use it to **show solidarity and apply pressure**)
* When you show up in large numbers during the strike, it puts a spotlight on what happens when the people who make our meals possible aren’t there. It shows everyone — loud and clear — that **dining workers are essential** and deserve respect, fair pay, and better conditions.
* It makes it clear the dining needs their workers 

Let’s show them that when workers unite, **UCI can’t ignore our power!!**

Let’s make it impossible to ignore:  
**Dining workers keep this campus running  and they deserve better.**

**STAND WITH WORKERS. STAND FOR FAIRNESS. STAND TOGETHER.**

UCDavis,top,Student Trucking Survey,According_Swing_4058,2,"Hey Everyone,   
  
I am a UC Davis student research team in MGT 120. My team and I are currently analyzing the trucking industry and the many issues and dysfunctions within the system. One of the main problems we are diving into is young people not pursuing careers in the trucking industry. The workforce is aging and not enough young people are joining to fill the gaps. We are looking to mainly survey high school students, but are also taking opinions of college students, parents, teachers, and counselors. Below I attached our team's anonymous survey, it should only take about 4-7 minutes to complete. Please share it with any high school/college students, parents, teachers, or counselors you know.   
  
Thank you and have a blessed day!

There was kind of a traffic jam of people on bikes waiting to turn left, so this older man (looked like a professor) decided to go into the wrong lane to avoid them. Problem is, I was in that lane turning right. So we collided head-on. He kinda stopped to ask if I was okay, and I (completely in shock) just said “yeah” because I didn’t even process what happened. He then rode off. I was not okay. I was bleeding from my mouth and now I’m missing a chunk of my front tooth. Like… an actual piece of my tooth is gone. So if anyone saw an older man biking the wrong way around that area last Thursday, please let me know.

Current freshman, she/her, Human Biology major, female, and I'm searching for more like-minded individuals who are interested in off-campus housing. Essentially, to sum it up I'm looking to befriend other first years who can become potential roommates until graduation.

I'm looking to meet an individual who is also first year and female. Someone willing to become apart of 4 people total. The plan is to tour places together!  We are already searching, our rough idea currently is looking like at most \~30 mins away from campus, 4 bedroom - 2 bathroom vibes.

**Key Interests:**

\- Minimalistic, we are looking for individuals who don't have a lot of decor. It's simpler for cleaning, avoiding spiders, etc.  
\- We all wake up relatively early, between the hours of 6-8am.  
\- We all don't like staying out late, normally back to our humble abode by 6-7pm.  
\- None of us drink, smoke, etc. 

**Goal:**

\- Just reply if you're interested in connecting or even if you're unsure!  
\- You can meet me, and other like-minded peers!  
\- Become housemates and have secured housing for the next 3 years (1 year leases, we don't want to be moving every year.)

Basically I have been emailing UCSC for months with little help. I got notice of some random ebill charge that i was emailed about, and popped up on my ebill July 2025. It says it’s from September 2022 due of 400. First of all, why would it pop up on my account only in July if i have checked my ebill account at least 15 times since winter 2022, and there was always a balance of zero because I paid off each quarter when it was due. Second of all, I graduated in August of 2024, so it’s kind of crazy i’d be getting random charges. I think it’s a scam. I just got a letter in the mail threatening me to pay the balance by 11/27 or they’re going to come after me with the franchise tax board. This is absolutely insane. When i asked them what exactly happened with the charge they said it was a returned check that they didn’t catch until now.

I need students to join so it can actually happen and be a functioning class. We're going to talk about BTS and K-pop, but it's all a lens to learn stuff through and you're not required to know anything or be a fan of these things to join the class. The class is pretty easy and does not require you to do a ton of course work. It's one reading and one design-related assignment each week. There's an option to be asynchronous too and still get credit. 

I'm an undergrad doing research and design work in Baskin under Dr. Kate Ringland and this class is under a program called Research Pathways. Basically, I'm an undergrad who teaches other undergrads so more undergrads can get into research at the university. I know some people saw my post from last quarter and couldn't join in fall but wanted to join in winter.

Unfortunately, I'll be graduating from UCSC and won't be here in spring to teach a spring session of the class. But if you still want to be involved in research, then look out for other CMPM 118 classes under the research pathways program.

Even a few people I recently met, who I thought I had good connections with, have started acting strange and seem to think they are somehow better than me.

I’ve taken some time to think about it, and I know I’m not the problem. I get along with people easily. I’m kind, friendly, and genuine. I treat everyone with respect, and I don’t go out of my way to create any kind of drama. But it’s clear that some people carry their own insecurities or hidden animosity, and that’s something I can’t control.

At this point, I’m learning to let people show who they really are. It hurts to realize that not everyone has good intentions, but I would rather know the truth than waste my energy on fake relationships.

* How important different elections feel to you
* Where you get information on candidates
* How easy and trustworthy that information is
