Berkeley,top,Melt Banana is playing at Cornerstone on November 12th,joshhug,11,"Hello everyone, it's me, Josh Hug. I am not usually on this reddit, but it felt important to let you know that Melt Banana will be playing a show in Berkeley at Cornerstone on a Wednesday night.

As backstory, when I was 21, my roommate Jonathan was in a Japanese class, and his TA told them Melt Banana was playing a show and that they should go. Jonathan invited me along, so I fired up Kazaa or Limewire or whatever it was back then and downloaded a Melt Banana song and thought 'hmm, well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. Nonetheless, I went, and it was a very good show and I figured out how to like this music.

Since then, I have seen them at least 10 times. It may be a slight exaggeration, but Melt Banana is one of the few institutions that I truly believe in. Their most recent album 3 + 5 is their most listenable, though you will probably listen and think 'hmm well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. But really it's Rachmaninoff level (or better?) composing if you have the right ear for it.

If you are a fan of 100 gecs or King Gizzard, then perhaps you will like them.

Note that about a decade ago, they ditched their live drummer and bassist, so be warned that it's just Agata playing guitar and Yasuko doing her version of singing along with a drum machine.",1.0,0,11,1762929632.0,1,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Events/Organizations,1762928975.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/

Berkeley,top,A new Berkeley tradition....like no other,InternationalHour860,9,"Hello Berkeley community.  I’ve had this vision for Berkeley for years now, a fantastic new tradition combining the Big Game and honoring Cal-affiliated Nobel Prize laureates, and bringing in the greater Berkeley community in a days long celebration of science, academia and community.  

I’m not an alum, but I did grow in North Oakland and spent a lot of time on campus, I even sold the programs at the football games.  I went to high school in Berkeley, so I feel like I need to get this thought off my chest that has been there for a long freaking time.  Here is a quick summary.

Summary: 

Berkeley is one of the top producers of Nobel Laureates in the world, 2nd right now behind Harvard, and that is alumni and faculty.  (Different rankings with slightly different metrics have different positions but Cal is always top 5).   Stanford is in the top ten at a distant 6th.  So every other year when the Big Game is in Berkeley, there would be a halftime show honoring newly awarded laureates over the last two years, which has happened consistently for quite a while.  Splash the rankings on the big screen and rub it in Stanford’s face, creating another rivalry and a new time honored tradition like no other.  Crowd goes wild and sings ""Big C"".

Leading up to the Big Game, the city would hold Science Week, where kid and family friendly displays and activities related to economics and the sciences are set up festival style on campus and into the surrounding area, with open houses for the various labs, staffed by current students and local high school students(and who knows, maybe a Laureate who works there/went there happens by for a chat).  Prior and current Nobel Laureates who don't live locally would be flown in by Berkeley to participate in the festivities should they choose to attend.  On campus their would be seminars/roundtables with the Laureates and students in the respective departments.  They would be put up at The Claremont and have a formal dinner on Friday evening.  The next day is the Big Game, and the new laureates are honored.  Afterwords is more informal engagements ending in going to a bar with history and class(like Heinhold’s First and Last Chance) where the past Laureates honor the new ones with a round of “He/she’s a jolly good fellow”.  

So that’s the short summary.  I have hour by hour details and variables in my head but would take too long to write lol.  I don’t know anywhere else to post this so here it is.  Perhaps this is a stupid idea, but heck I think it would be a unique tradition that no other college town is doing, or can really do in the first place.  The Laureates deserve more than a free parking space, and so does the community and campus for fostering the environment that produces so many.   Maybe someone here knows people in high places to get this to or point me in the right direction, or maybe it sucks and the idea dies right here, right now……",0.76,0,9,False,3,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Local,1762924126.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/

Berkeley,top,"Berkeley, where would you rather eat? I built something for you.",TheShynola,0,"

Hi,  
I’ve mapped out Berkeley dining scene in an app I built called Vota. The idea is simple: you see two restaurants side by side, pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the smarter the list becomes. You can vote outside of Berkeley as well.

You could, for example, compare Chez Panisse with Sliver Pizzeria\* - completely different experiences, but over time, even very different places naturally find their true level in the ranking.

No fake reviews. No influencers. No ads. No AI-generated text. Just real votes from real people who actually eat here. No Tripadvisor noise, no Google clutter - only simple, honest comparisons.  
The app is free, doesn’t require registration, and collects no personal data.

Here’s the iPhone version:  
[https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212](https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212)

And here’s the Android version, which just went live  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)

It’s not perfect, bunch of P.S. I’m not studying at Berkeley (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, sell anything, or use AI content inside the app. However \*the restaurants above are just examples, chosen with a bit of AI help.

Berkeley,hot,"🔥 Urban Compassion Project’s  first-ever Berkeley cleanup! 🔥Volunteers and homeless neighbors teamed up to clear 24,000 pounds of dumping from 8th and Harrison, one of the city’s worst dumping hotspots. Energy was unreal! Berkeley, we will be back!",urbancompassionproj,230,"Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland. In that time, we’ve connected with more than 9,500 people living on the fringes, providing outreach and support with zero city funding.

This year alone, we’ve had over 1,900 volunteers come out to help us clear more than 600 tons of trash from over 50 sites across the Bay Area.

Our impact in Oakland has been huge, but we’re not stopping there. We’re expanding into new cities like Berkeley and beyond. With a growing network of over 3,000 volunteers, our model focuses on keeping areas clean while working directly with unhoused residents to get them the resources they need and ultimately to help them transition off the streets.

One of our most powerful initiatives is the Homeless Ambassador Program, which provides paid stipends to unhoused individuals to maintain clean areas. This approach creates ownership, opportunity, and dignity while building stronger community ties.

We’ve also worked hard to change the narrative about who’s responsible for illegal dumping. Many people wrongly assume unhoused residents are the main cause of dumping, but the truth is they’re often scapegoated while being the ones most impacted. We’ve documented countless cases of illegal commercial and residential dumping that target encampments simply because those living there have no voice.

About 75 percent of the areas we’ve cleaned remain clean, thanks to consistent monitoring and community collaboration. Urban Compassion Project is here for everyone in the community, housed or unhoused, and we’ll continue to step up where others won’t.

been seeing these creepy fliers for this AI dating app since last year, then 2 weeks ago dozens spammed all over every bus stop 

so i got curious and i found posts from other user saying: 

UCSD is getting spammed too 

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1oecjof/can_we_kill_ditto_ai_they_have_infected_this/

one of their devs basically admitted they got hacked and bots were used to spam the entire UCSD campus email system. he didn't say they got hacked, but i've never heard of bots sending spam emails over your custom email domain w/o your domain having been legit data breached / pwned... the emails came from their own email infrastructure, so... just connecting the dots

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1k0e0bt/ditto_ai_dittai/

a user claims Ditto's head of growth legally threatened them for posting negative feedback on their social media, and talking about their privacy policy 

here's the privacy policy btw... super sus!!!

&gt; ""We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences)""

&gt; ""despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information""

this one is weird, they literally use chatbot avatars mimicking users's profiles to converse with other users' chatbot avatars... these are legit using traits inferred by whatever (possibly biased) algorithms they run on you

&gt; ""We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you."" 


&gt; ""We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company""


their CEO literally said their head of marketing has a daytime job doing surgery at a bioengineering startup and then does ditto as their night job 

this really doesn't look like the next big thing, and the romanticized SFGate and KVTU coverage tries to make them sound almost heoric. 


but what's the reality? 

is ditto tone-deaf and aggressive on marketing, playing up being young, ambitious dropouts trying to disrupt modern dating - for hype? 


everything i found makes them look hellaaaa sus - especially using AI to reduce you into a commodity... what do their algorithms do on people who don't fit the mold? those are the people i want to hear from in the comments, cause my BIPOC friends who joined literally never heard anything after signing up, for months

so, what are these algorithms doing? ranking us, rating us, filtering us, matching us - based on what? how are black and brown folk doing? can a muslim meet another muslim on it? do short kings exist here?  how are users actually empowered rather than used? 

i have no data to back this up about ditto specifically, but this ain't exactly news:

Berkeley,hot,Can't Decide on Switching Majors from App. Math to Econ,jam751,3,"I am a first semester transfer student, Applied Math major, currently taking Math-110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) and Musa 74 (Math-55 was fulfilled for some reason). No prior proof experience.

I am currently doing pretty bad in Math-110. I got a 5/29 on the first midterm (mean was 13.5, std was 8.22) and got a 5/29 again on the second midterm (mean was 12.69, std was 7.75). I don't really care about gpa, I care about passing and learning the class/material, and my gpa would just reflect that.

I'm not interested in grad school. My main career choice is to be an actuary, but having to spend all of my time studying for an upper-division math class with abstract proof-writing (which I would most likely not have to ever see again in my line of work) instead of developing actual technical skills feels like such a waste of time.

As a result, my line of reasoning is that if I can switch to an easier major/subject which I still enjoy, relates to my line of work, and gives me more time, then I can make that switch and concentrate in developing said technical skills.

So, I chose Economics. I actually do enjoy the subject quite a bit, passed the AP Macro Exam with a 5 back in HS. After talking to an advisor, they've said it is possible to do the switch (not guaranteed tho) if I can just fulfill all the required courses by next semester and submit an appeal. So, I've enrolled in classes next semester that helps me fulfill those requirements.

I don't like to gamble all on one thing though, so I made a plan that if I do not end up switching over to Econ for whatever reason, I would still be on track to graduate on time with Applied Math (even if I fail/drop Math 110 this semester).

Some closing remarks, my performance in Math-110 has been very disheartening for me and it has left me wondering if I can really succeed in upper-div math. I'm definitely more than willing to redo the course if I fail/drop, but it makes me wonder, if there is an easier path to reach the same destination, why not take it?

And the only thing that's been holding me back from switching is the versatility that I hear so much about regarding a degree on Applied Math. Although I do want to be an actuary, I'm open and flexible to applying for other quantitative roles, and I am not sure if an Econ degree offers the same level of versatility and weight (I've heard....things about the job market/demand for Econ degrees). So, any input would be welcome, thank you!

**Tl;Dr:**

* I am a first semester transfer student majoring in Applied Math.  
* Currently taking Math 110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) w/ no prior proof experience and currently struggling (5/29 on both midterms, well below the average(stats specified above)).  
* I am not aiming for grad school; main career goal is to become an actuary.  
* I feel that spending excessive time on abstract proof-heavy math (irrelevant to field of work) is inefficient compared to developing technical/professional skills.  
* Currently considering switching to Economics, a subject I enjoy and find more relevant.
   * Advisor said it's possible if I complete the requirements by next semester and appeal.  
* Made a backup plan so I can still gradate on time with Applied Math even if I fail/drop Math 110  
* My main concern: whether switching to econ would limit my career flexibility or make me less competitive compared to staying in Applied Math?  

**Here's some questions I'd like to get answered if possible:**

1. How likely am I to pass Math 110 at this point?  
2. Does an Applied Math degree carry significant weight with employers (i.e. seen as rigorous or impressive)?  
3. How bad or competitive is the Economics job market, especially for quantitative or data-related roles?  
4. Would switching from Applied Math to Economics be a smart move considering my goals (actuarial career, employability, time efficiency)?

Berkeley,hot,Recent transplant from South Bay - what’s wrong with Berkeley?,Good-Adeptness8476,0,"I’ll start with traffic management. The city has just the right mixture of two-way and 4-way stops to keep everyone on their toes constantly. If you stop right behind the stop sign there is a fair to good chance you won’t see an incoming car due to all the cars parked curb side. Speaking of parking - there are practically no attached garages, or two-car garages anywhere, so all streets are filled with cars parked curb side. Parking enforcement vehicles swarm the town like hungry coyotes.

All medical clinics are severely understaffed. Social service is extremely bureaucratic, condescending and rude(I know this is the County, but still) . School district appears to be managed by agents of chaos - it’s really challenging to sort through all the paperwork to settle your kids into a school if you are a newcomer. And be prepared that your paperwork ends up on the wrong side of the event horizon. 

People are generally very nice and easy to approach, but on the internet they act like Goofy with “cyber-rage syndrome” - judgmental, sarcastic or otherwise unpleasant. Browse through NextDoor you’ll see. 

Even the garbage pickup is a nightmare to deal with. My yard waste bin disappeared on a pickup day once and didn’t get emptied twice. The pickup bill is outrageous expensive, even comparing to other (higher income) Bay Area counties.
