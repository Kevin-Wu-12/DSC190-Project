Berkeley,hot,Grow a spine,notesofadistantsong,317,"To everyone on this subreddit saying ""you took the bait"", we get it. You took one game theory class and know what will happen next, or you're a smarter leftist, or you're just morally righteous enough to see what the rest of us supposedly can't. You've concluded that the only winning move is not to play. Just realize that by ""not playing” you are not only apathetic to the harm caused and will cause by this organization but also spineless.

Yes, we all know the function of this event was to be FOX News media fodder. That isn't a brilliant, subversive insight. It's the most obvious part of their playbook. They come here wanting a reaction. They get one. They cut it up. They fundraise off it. This is not a secret.

But the alternative you propose: to not engage or do not mind them is its own form of ""taking the bait.""
You're letting them take our plaza. You're letting them speak to an empty, quiet campus, which they will also use as media fodder, spinning it as ""The Silent Majority at [School Name] Welcomes Us"" or ""The Woke Mob Was Too Scared to Show Up.""

They will always have their footage. Your inaction doesn't stop their media machine; it just gives them a different, more insidious victory: the victory of an unchallenged platform.

Take these legal precedents:
 — The Supreme Court has Brandenburg v. Ohio because we, as a country, recognize that speech can cross the line into ""inciting or producing imminent lawless action.""
 — We have Virginia v. Black because we recognize that speech can, and does, function as a ""true threat,"" intended to intimidate and place people in fear of bodily harm.
When an organization's rhetoric consistently leads to doxxing, harassment, and credible death threats against students, faculty, and marginalized communities, it is not ""just speech."" Look at Professor Watchlist. It is the precursor to abuse. Look at the the talking points of the late organization’s president. Let me repeat, look at the threats on professors from and because of the watchlist. I’m sure you aware of everything else that this org stands for and is connected to.

Showing up is not about ""winning a debate"" with them. It's about a community standing up to say, unequivocally, that this behavior—this engine of stochastic terror is not welcome here. It is about showing the people they target that they are not alone.

I was at the protest for the majority of it. 
From 4 PM to 9 PM, there were 1,000+ 
people. And despite the far right media's desperate hunt for ""violence,"" what happened? Two people scrapped over a sign, and one person leaning over a barricade was predictably dragged by riot police. That's it. (And no, the smoke from a car's burnout that has been spun to be munitions or ANTIFA tear gas is not ""protestor violence."") Everyone knows of the right leaning media’s plan, which is why we just made noise without any specific threats other than get out. Most of the chants are also an extension of the disapproval of the Trump administration who use TPUSA as a cultural factory line towards a kneeling to authoritarianism, and financially backs it too.

This protest was an overwhelming, somewhat massive, and peaceful show of community rejection. I am so proud of the students who showed up. I am so disappointed in the privilege of students at this public university who are in favor of this ""strategy"" as an excuse for apathy.  this ""I'm a better leftist/changemaker/whatever than you because I don't protest"" rhetoric is so lame. The opposite of their TPUSA ideology is real education, and that education demands action.

I get why they're bad - you can't tolerate another person's intolerance, because then you are just allowing something harmful to continue.

But, the protesting didn't seem to achieve much besides bring visibility to the student's hate for the group, and served as a photo op for right-wing media to frame the opposition to TPUSA ""violent"" and ""bloody"", painting them as defenders of free speech against a hostile liberal agenda.

I see a lot of journalists and public figures (the name Mehdi Hasan comes to mind) who simply decline to engage with people who have fascist or intolerant beliefs because acknowledging such ideas gives them a form of validity.

In the case of TPUSA's presence at Cal, part of me feels like simply not showing up or talking with them would be a more powerful form of protest than what we saw. These people are there to ""prove"" their twisted ideology using free speech as a shield, and we have to play on that field. Should the answer be not to reach over and silence them, but to turn away and ignore them? It's like dealing with a toddler who is certain that the sky is green. There's no logical discourse where you can prove that it's blue, so you just have to walk away and let them realize they're wrong when it happens again and again. 

I'm conflicted because on one hand, I don't want people feed hateful rhetoric among themselves and have it fester into something dangerous, but on the other, responding to them with a loud opposition gives them greater reason to defend and promote their ideas.

Berkeley,hot,Melt Banana is playing at Cornerstone on November 12th,joshhug,86,"Hello everyone, it's me, Josh Hug. I am not usually on this reddit, but it felt important to let you know that Melt Banana will be playing a show in Berkeley at Cornerstone on a Wednesday night.

As backstory, when I was 21, my roommate Jonathan was in a Japanese class, and his TA told them Melt Banana was playing a show and that they should go. Jonathan invited me along, so I fired up Kazaa or Limewire or whatever it was back then and downloaded a Melt Banana song and thought 'hmm, well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. Nonetheless, I went, and it was a very good show and I figured out how to like this music.

Since then, I have seen them at least 10 times. It may be a slight exaggeration, but Melt Banana is one of the few institutions that I truly believe in. Their most recent album 3 + 5 is their most listenable, though you will probably listen and think 'hmm well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. But really it's Rachmaninoff level (or better?) composing if you have the right ear for it.

If you are a fan of 100 gecs or King Gizzard, then perhaps you will like them.

Note that about a decade ago, they ditched their live drummer and bassist, so be warned that it's just Agata playing guitar and Yasuko doing her version of singing along with a drum machine.",1.0,0,86,1762929632.0,7,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Events/Organizations,1762928975.0,168666,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/

Berkeley,hot,A new Berkeley tradition....like no other,InternationalHour860,22,"Hello Berkeley community.  I’ve had this vision for Berkeley for years now, a fantastic new tradition combining the Big Game and honoring Cal-affiliated Nobel Prize laureates, and bringing in the greater Berkeley community in a days long celebration of science, academia and community.  

I’m not an alum, but I did grow in North Oakland and spent a lot of time on campus, I even sold the programs at the football games.  I went to high school in Berkeley, so I feel like I need to get this thought off my chest that has been there for a long freaking time.  Here is a quick summary.

Summary: 

Berkeley is one of the top producers of Nobel Laureates in the world, 2nd right now behind Harvard, and that is alumni and faculty.  (Different rankings with slightly different metrics have different positions but Cal is always top 5).   Stanford is in the top ten at a distant 6th.  So every other year when the Big Game is in Berkeley, there would be a halftime show honoring newly awarded laureates over the last two years, which has happened consistently for quite a while.  Splash the rankings on the big screen and rub it in Stanford’s face, creating another rivalry and a new time honored tradition like no other.  Crowd goes wild and sings ""Big C"".

Leading up to the Big Game, the city would hold Science Week, where kid and family friendly displays and activities related to economics and the sciences are set up festival style on campus and into the surrounding area, with open houses for the various labs, staffed by current students and local high school students(and who knows, maybe a Laureate who works there/went there happens by for a chat).  Prior and current Nobel Laureates who don't live locally would be flown in by Berkeley to participate in the festivities should they choose to attend.  On campus their would be seminars/roundtables with the Laureates and students in the respective departments.  They would be put up at The Claremont and have a formal dinner on Friday evening.  The next day is the Big Game, and the new laureates are honored.  Afterwords is more informal engagements ending in going to a bar with history and class(like Heinhold’s First and Last Chance) where the past Laureates honor the new ones with a round of “He/she’s a jolly good fellow”.  

So that’s the short summary.  I have hour by hour details and variables in my head but would take too long to write lol.  I don’t know anywhere else to post this so here it is.  Perhaps this is a stupid idea, but heck I think it would be a unique tradition that no other college town is doing, or can really do in the first place.  The Laureates deserve more than a free parking space, and so does the community and campus for fostering the environment that produces so many.   Maybe someone here knows people in high places to get this to or point me in the right direction, or maybe it sucks and the idea dies right here, right now……",0.77,0,22,False,12,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Local,1762924126.0,168666,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/

Berkeley,hot,"Berkeley, where would you rather eat? I built something for you.",TheShynola,0,"

Hi,  
I’ve mapped out Berkeley dining scene in an app I built called Vota. The idea is simple: you see two restaurants side by side, pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the smarter the list becomes. You can vote outside of Berkeley as well.

You could, for example, compare Chez Panisse with Sliver Pizzeria\* - completely different experiences, but over time, even very different places naturally find their true level in the ranking.

No fake reviews. No influencers. No ads. No AI-generated text. Just real votes from real people who actually eat here. No Tripadvisor noise, no Google clutter - only simple, honest comparisons.  
The app is free, doesn’t require registration, and collects no personal data.

Here’s the iPhone version:  
[https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212](https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212)

And here’s the Android version, which just went live  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)

It’s not perfect, bunch of P.S. I’m not studying at Berkeley (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, sell anything, or use AI content inside the app. However \*the restaurants above are just examples, chosen with a bit of AI help. I’d love to see how you, as a community would rank your favourite restaurants across the city.

Berkeley,hot,"🔥 Urban Compassion Project’s  first-ever Berkeley cleanup! 🔥Volunteers and homeless neighbors teamed up to clear 24,000 pounds of dumping from 8th and Harrison, one of the city’s worst dumping hotspots. Energy was unreal! Berkeley, we will be back!",urbancompassionproj,235,"Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland. In that time, we’ve connected with more than 9,500 people living on the fringes, providing outreach and support with zero city funding.

This year alone, we’ve had over 1,900 volunteers come out to help us clear more than 600 tons of trash from over 50 sites across the Bay Area.

Our impact in Oakland has been huge, but we’re not stopping there. We’re expanding into new cities like Berkeley and beyond. With a growing network of over 3,000 volunteers, our model focuses on keeping areas clean while working directly with unhoused residents to get them the resources they need and ultimately to help them transition off the streets.

One of our most powerful initiatives is the Homeless Ambassador Program, which provides paid stipends to unhoused individuals to maintain clean areas. This approach creates ownership, opportunity, and dignity while building stronger community ties.

We’ve also worked hard to change the narrative about who’s responsible for illegal dumping. Many people wrongly assume unhoused residents are the main cause of dumping, but the truth is they’re often scapegoated while being the ones most impacted. We’ve documented countless cases of illegal commercial and residential dumping that target encampments simply because those living there have no voice.

About 75 percent of the areas we’ve cleaned remain clean, thanks to consistent monitoring and community collaboration. Urban Compassion Project is here for everyone in the community, housed or unhoused, and we’ll continue to step up where others won’t.

The city has just the right mixture of two-way and 4-way stops to keep everyone on their toes constantly. If you stop right behind the stop sign there is a fair to good chance you won’t see an incoming car due to all the cars parked curb side. Speaking of parking - there are practically no attached garages, or two-car garages anywhere, so all streets are filled with cars parked curb side. Parking enforcement vehicles swarm the town like hungry coyotes.

All medical clinics are severely understaffed. Social service is extremely bureaucratic, condescending and rude(I know this is the County, but still) . School district appears to be managed by agents of chaos - it’s really challenging to sort through all the paperwork to settle your kids into a school if you are a newcomer.
