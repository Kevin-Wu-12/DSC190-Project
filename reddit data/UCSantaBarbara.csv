Berkeley,top,Melt Banana is playing at Cornerstone on November 12th,joshhug,11,"Hello everyone, it's me, Josh Hug. I am not usually on this reddit, but it felt important to let you know that Melt Banana will be playing a show in Berkeley at Cornerstone on a Wednesday night.

As backstory, when I was 21, my roommate Jonathan was in a Japanese class, and his TA told them Melt Banana was playing a show and that they should go. Jonathan invited me along, so I fired up Kazaa or Limewire or whatever it was back then and downloaded a Melt Banana song and thought 'hmm, well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. Nonetheless, I went, and it was a very good show and I figured out how to like this music.

Since then, I have seen them at least 10 times. It may be a slight exaggeration, but Melt Banana is one of the few institutions that I truly believe in. Their most recent album 3 + 5 is their most listenable, though you will probably listen and think 'hmm well this is unlistenable and shrill chaos'. But really it's Rachmaninoff level (or better?) composing if you have the right ear for it.

If you are a fan of 100 gecs or King Gizzard, then perhaps you will like them.

Note that about a decade ago, they ditched their live drummer and bassist, so be warned that it's just Agata playing guitar and Yasuko doing her version of singing along with a drum machine.",1.0,0,11,1762929632.0,1,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Events/Organizations,1762928975.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouxvl6/melt_banana_is_playing_at_cornerstone_on_november/

Berkeley,top,A new Berkeley tradition....like no other,InternationalHour860,9,"Hello Berkeley community.  I’ve had this vision for Berkeley for years now, a fantastic new tradition combining the Big Game and honoring Cal-affiliated Nobel Prize laureates, and bringing in the greater Berkeley community in a days long celebration of science, academia and community.  

I’m not an alum, but I did grow in North Oakland and spent a lot of time on campus, I even sold the programs at the football games.  I went to high school in Berkeley, so I feel like I need to get this thought off my chest that has been there for a long freaking time.  Here is a quick summary.

Summary: 

Berkeley is one of the top producers of Nobel Laureates in the world, 2nd right now behind Harvard, and that is alumni and faculty.  (Different rankings with slightly different metrics have different positions but Cal is always top 5).   Stanford is in the top ten at a distant 6th.  So every other year when the Big Game is in Berkeley, there would be a halftime show honoring newly awarded laureates over the last two years, which has happened consistently for quite a while.  Splash the rankings on the big screen and rub it in Stanford’s face, creating another rivalry and a new time honored tradition like no other.  Crowd goes wild and sings ""Big C"".

Leading up to the Big Game, the city would hold Science Week, where kid and family friendly displays and activities related to economics and the sciences are set up festival style on campus and into the surrounding area, with open houses for the various labs, staffed by current students and local high school students(and who knows, maybe a Laureate who works there/went there happens by for a chat).  Prior and current Nobel Laureates who don't live locally would be flown in by Berkeley to participate in the festivities should they choose to attend.  On campus their would be seminars/roundtables with the Laureates and students in the respective departments.  They would be put up at The Claremont and have a formal dinner on Friday evening.  The next day is the Big Game, and the new laureates are honored.  Afterwords is more informal engagements ending in going to a bar with history and class(like Heinhold’s First and Last Chance) where the past Laureates honor the new ones with a round of “He/she’s a jolly good fellow”.  

So that’s the short summary.  I have hour by hour details and variables in my head but would take too long to write lol.  I don’t know anywhere else to post this so here it is.  Perhaps this is a stupid idea, but heck I think it would be a unique tradition that no other college town is doing, or can really do in the first place.  The Laureates deserve more than a free parking space, and so does the community and campus for fostering the environment that produces so many.   Maybe someone here knows people in high places to get this to or point me in the right direction, or maybe it sucks and the idea dies right here, right now……",0.76,0,9,False,3,True,False,False,self.berkeley,Local,1762924126.0,168611,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ouwgd8/a_new_berkeley_traditionlike_no_other/

Berkeley,top,"Berkeley, where would you rather eat? I built something for you.",TheShynola,0,"

Hi,  
I’ve mapped out Berkeley dining scene in an app I built called Vota. The idea is simple: you see two restaurants side by side, pick the one you prefer, and the ranking updates instantly. The more people vote, the smarter the list becomes. You can vote outside of Berkeley as well.

You could, for example, compare Chez Panisse with Sliver Pizzeria\* - completely different experiences, but over time, even very different places naturally find their true level in the ranking.

No fake reviews. No influencers. No ads. No AI-generated text. Just real votes from real people who actually eat here. No Tripadvisor noise, no Google clutter - only simple, honest comparisons.  
The app is free, doesn’t require registration, and collects no personal data.

Here’s the iPhone version:  
[https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212](https://apps.apple.com/app/vota-restaurant-ratings/id6744969212)

And here’s the Android version, which just went live  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vota.app)

It’s not perfect, bunch of P.S. I’m not studying at Berkeley (I live in Gothenburg). I don’t collect data, sell anything, or use AI content inside the app. However \*the restaurants above are just examples, chosen with a bit of AI help.

Berkeley,hot,"🔥 Urban Compassion Project’s  first-ever Berkeley cleanup! 🔥Volunteers and homeless neighbors teamed up to clear 24,000 pounds of dumping from 8th and Harrison, one of the city’s worst dumping hotspots. Energy was unreal! Berkeley, we will be back!",urbancompassionproj,230,"Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland. In that time, we’ve connected with more than 9,500 people living on the fringes, providing outreach and support with zero city funding.

This year alone, we’ve had over 1,900 volunteers come out to help us clear more than 600 tons of trash from over 50 sites across the Bay Area.

Our impact in Oakland has been huge, but we’re not stopping there. We’re expanding into new cities like Berkeley and beyond. With a growing network of over 3,000 volunteers, our model focuses on keeping areas clean while working directly with unhoused residents to get them the resources they need and ultimately to help them transition off the streets.

One of our most powerful initiatives is the Homeless Ambassador Program, which provides paid stipends to unhoused individuals to maintain clean areas. This approach creates ownership, opportunity, and dignity while building stronger community ties.

We’ve also worked hard to change the narrative about who’s responsible for illegal dumping. Many people wrongly assume unhoused residents are the main cause of dumping, but the truth is they’re often scapegoated while being the ones most impacted. We’ve documented countless cases of illegal commercial and residential dumping that target encampments simply because those living there have no voice.

About 75 percent of the areas we’ve cleaned remain clean, thanks to consistent monitoring and community collaboration. Urban Compassion Project is here for everyone in the community, housed or unhoused, and we’ll continue to step up where others won’t.

been seeing these creepy fliers for this AI dating app since last year, then 2 weeks ago dozens spammed all over every bus stop 

so i got curious and i found posts from other user saying: 

UCSD is getting spammed too 

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1oecjof/can_we_kill_ditto_ai_they_have_infected_this/

one of their devs basically admitted they got hacked and bots were used to spam the entire UCSD campus email system. he didn't say they got hacked, but i've never heard of bots sending spam emails over your custom email domain w/o your domain having been legit data breached / pwned... the emails came from their own email infrastructure, so... just connecting the dots

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1k0e0bt/ditto_ai_dittai/

a user claims Ditto's head of growth legally threatened them for posting negative feedback on their social media, and talking about their privacy policy 

here's the privacy policy btw... super sus!!!

&gt; ""We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences)""

&gt; ""despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information""

this one is weird, they literally use chatbot avatars mimicking users's profiles to converse with other users' chatbot avatars... these are legit using traits inferred by whatever (possibly biased) algorithms they run on you

&gt; ""We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you."" 


&gt; ""We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company""


their CEO literally said their head of marketing has a daytime job doing surgery at a bioengineering startup and then does ditto as their night job 

this really doesn't look like the next big thing, and the romanticized SFGate and KVTU coverage tries to make them sound almost heoric. 


but what's the reality? 

is ditto tone-deaf and aggressive on marketing, playing up being young, ambitious dropouts trying to disrupt modern dating - for hype? 


everything i found makes them look hellaaaa sus - especially using AI to reduce you into a commodity... what do their algorithms do on people who don't fit the mold? those are the people i want to hear from in the comments, cause my BIPOC friends who joined literally never heard anything after signing up, for months

so, what are these algorithms doing? ranking us, rating us, filtering us, matching us - based on what? how are black and brown folk doing? can a muslim meet another muslim on it? do short kings exist here?  how are users actually empowered rather than used? 

i have no data to back this up about ditto specifically, but this ain't exactly news:

Berkeley,hot,Can't Decide on Switching Majors from App. Math to Econ,jam751,3,"I am a first semester transfer student, Applied Math major, currently taking Math-110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) and Musa 74 (Math-55 was fulfilled for some reason). No prior proof experience.

I am currently doing pretty bad in Math-110. I got a 5/29 on the first midterm (mean was 13.5, std was 8.22) and got a 5/29 again on the second midterm (mean was 12.69, std was 7.75). I don't really care about gpa, I care about passing and learning the class/material, and my gpa would just reflect that.

I'm not interested in grad school. My main career choice is to be an actuary, but having to spend all of my time studying for an upper-division math class with abstract proof-writing (which I would most likely not have to ever see again in my line of work) instead of developing actual technical skills feels like such a waste of time.

As a result, my line of reasoning is that if I can switch to an easier major/subject which I still enjoy, relates to my line of work, and gives me more time, then I can make that switch and concentrate in developing said technical skills.

So, I chose Economics. I actually do enjoy the subject quite a bit, passed the AP Macro Exam with a 5 back in HS. After talking to an advisor, they've said it is possible to do the switch (not guaranteed tho) if I can just fulfill all the required courses by next semester and submit an appeal. So, I've enrolled in classes next semester that helps me fulfill those requirements.

I don't like to gamble all on one thing though, so I made a plan that if I do not end up switching over to Econ for whatever reason, I would still be on track to graduate on time with Applied Math (even if I fail/drop Math 110 this semester).

Some closing remarks, my performance in Math-110 has been very disheartening for me and it has left me wondering if I can really succeed in upper-div math. I'm definitely more than willing to redo the course if I fail/drop, but it makes me wonder, if there is an easier path to reach the same destination, why not take it?

And the only thing that's been holding me back from switching is the versatility that I hear so much about regarding a degree on Applied Math. Although I do want to be an actuary, I'm open and flexible to applying for other quantitative roles, and I am not sure if an Econ degree offers the same level of versatility and weight (I've heard....things about the job market/demand for Econ degrees). So, any input would be welcome, thank you!

**Tl;Dr:**

* I am a first semester transfer student majoring in Applied Math.  
* Currently taking Math 110 (Abstract Linear Algebra) w/ no prior proof experience and currently struggling (5/29 on both midterms, well below the average(stats specified above)).  
* I am not aiming for grad school; main career goal is to become an actuary.  
* I feel that spending excessive time on abstract proof-heavy math (irrelevant to field of work) is inefficient compared to developing technical/professional skills.  
* Currently considering switching to Economics, a subject I enjoy and find more relevant.
   * Advisor said it's possible if I complete the requirements by next semester and appeal.  
* Made a backup plan so I can still gradate on time with Applied Math even if I fail/drop Math 110  
* My main concern: whether switching to econ would limit my career flexibility or make me less competitive compared to staying in Applied Math?  

**Here's some questions I'd like to get answered if possible:**

1. How likely am I to pass Math 110 at this point?  
2. Does an Applied Math degree carry significant weight with employers (i.e. seen as rigorous or impressive)?  
3. How bad or competitive is the Economics job market, especially for quantitative or data-related roles?  
4. Would switching from Applied Math to Economics be a smart move considering my goals (actuarial career, employability, time efficiency)?

Berkeley,hot,Recent transplant from South Bay - what’s wrong with Berkeley?,Good-Adeptness8476,0,"I’ll start with traffic management. The city has just the right mixture of two-way and 4-way stops to keep everyone on their toes constantly. If you stop right behind the stop sign there is a fair to good chance you won’t see an incoming car due to all the cars parked curb side. Speaking of parking - there are practically no attached garages, or two-car garages anywhere, so all streets are filled with cars parked curb side. Parking enforcement vehicles swarm the town like hungry coyotes.

All medical clinics are severely understaffed. Social service is extremely bureaucratic, condescending and rude(I know this is the County, but still) . School district appears to be managed by agents of chaos - it’s really challenging to sort through all the paperwork to settle your kids into a school if you are a newcomer. And be prepared that your paperwork ends up on the wrong side of the event horizon. 

People are generally very nice and easy to approach, but on the internet they act like Goofy with “cyber-rage syndrome” - judgmental, sarcastic or otherwise unpleasant. Browse through NextDoor you’ll see. 

Even the garbage pickup is a nightmare to deal with. My yard waste bin disappeared on a pickup day once and didn’t get emptied twice. The pickup bill is outrageous expensive, even comparing to other (higher income) Bay Area counties.

ucla,top,How do I get a job at UCLA? It’s been so hard 😩,eviestar444,11,"
Hey everyone,
I’ve been trying to get a job at Santa Monica UCLA for a while now, but it’s honestly been really hard. I live in LA like there’s no way no phlebotomy or medical assistant jobs are hiring!!! I’ve applied to a bunch of positions (mostly clinical/front desk/patient-related jobs) through their career website, and other jobs as well but I never hear back. I’m certified in phlebotomy and soon to be a certified medical assistant, and I really want to work somewhere like UCLA Health since that’s also where I plan to transfer for nursing.

If anyone here works at UCLA Health or has gotten hired before, do you have any advice or tips? Like are there certain positions that are easier to get into first? Should I email HR or try to connect with someone who already works there? I really want to get my foot in the door but I’m starting to feel stuck.

Any tips or experiences would seriously help a lot 🙏

A bit about me. From Italy, I’m first gen and non-traditional student currently studying Spanish and Business Administration at Los Angeles City College. I’m also part of the UCLA CCCP program, and a part-time worker. I learned Spanish as a second language and I’m passionate about community and culture, which is why I chose this major.

If you have any advice on how to succeed in the Spanish program, like study tips, helpful professors, or what to expect from upper-division classes, I’d really appreciate it! Pleas
Thank you so much for your help!

Hi everyone! I've been looking through reddit posts and I see a recurring theme that taking chem6c and 7L will be very time consuming and difficult so I was wondering if anyone can give me advice on this schedule? It's going to be painfully physics and chem heavy which is why i'm really scared but it's kinda necessary for me to have to schedule these classes altogether. If I absolutely should switch out one of the chem courses, I could possibly do an upper-division bio like BIEB but I have a sliver of hope that I can handle these courses. As a background, i'm doing pretty decent in chem 6B (about a B grade) and i'm doing well in physics 1A/AL (I think I have at least a B+ or A-). I'm also a commuter who lives about 45mins away from campus so that's why I prefer stacking my classes to have T/TH free.

# How do I login to check my admissions decision?

You should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).

# How does the college I got matter? Can I change college? 

For freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.

Your major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (from Seventh to Eighth). 

You cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable.

UCSD,hot,rant and questions,GrilledGreenBean007,0,"Hi!

I am a first year at UCSD and things have not been going that well. Classes and profs are fine but I feel like I am missing out on something. The experience here for the past 1.5 months has not been what I thought it was going to be like at all, and has been somewhat traumatic and exhausting. The campus is ugly and depressing and there is no pretty building/traditional collegiate architecture. There are so many foreign students that it does not feel like an American university, it feels sometimes like I am in Asia and I don't like it (I just wish that there was just more culturally American people like myself here). There is no football team which is kind of depressing as even though I don't like football, the games and the vibes would be cool and make for fun memories/experiences (though I know that I choose this school knowing that there is no team here). I also feel like people don't really show up that much to other sports/there is a lack of school pride/cohesion/community/unification here. I am not a big sports person myself however I think in college it is fun to root for your school and participate in things like that if you know what I mean, and I feel like there is a lack of a unifying/unified thing/community here if that makes sense. I don't know, things just seem sort of dead.

I try to look on the bright side though and see how fortunate I am to be studying here and all  of the opportunities that the school provides from the education to the location (beach, Trader Joes, Ralph's, a theater, Barnes and Noble, World Market, CVS, Target) and clubs. This school has everything I need to thrive, though I just still feel like I am not thriving in it.

One thing I do love is how here I can just do my own thing and things aren't too competitive/cut-throat. At least with the people that I have met thus far and the places that I have been people want to more or less help each other succeed, as I know that at other colleges things are much more ""toxic"", cut-throat and competitive compared to here so I like the chill, layed backed attitudes/vibes that people have here.

Overall, I just don't know. Just the whole vibe and general demographic and look of the school was not at all what I thought it was going to be and I it makes me somewhat sad and feeling like I am missing out on a true college experience. There is just **something** missing. This place just seems a little empty/odd. Does anybody else feel that way or is it just me? And please don't say that I am not reaching out enough. I am not an anti-social person and have joined quite a few clubs/things looking for ""my people"", but they seem harder to come across than what I once thought. I am still reaching out to people, looking at new clubs to join to see which ones I want to stick to, and continue to go to classes and work hard on my studies.

I still have no true friends here (though I know that it is still pretty early on in the year) and just have some people that I know a little. Of course, my overall goal here is to get my degree and just have a good/happy, well-rounded and traditional college experience.

  
Does anyone else feel like they are missing out on something by being here? Have you been able to solve it? Is it just me? I am still trying to give UCSD a chance, but I am not sure if I will stick around for all 4 years. We will have to see.

UCSD,hot,take COGS 180 this Winter 2026!,drlucylai,144,"**hi everyone!**

i'm a new professor in COGS and am super excited to be offering **COGS 180: Decision Making in the Brain** next quarter (Winter 2026) on ***T***u/Th ***at 3:30-4:50pm in FAH 1450.***

this course hasn't been offered in years, because the professor who created it left UCSD awhile ago. as a result, **i’ve completely redesigned COGS 180** to be an **interactive deep dive into the cognitive and neural processes that underlie human decision making.**

this **interdisciplinary course** blends ideas from psychology, neuroscience, economics, psychiatry, design, and ai. you’ll read and discuss research papers, give group presentations, and complete a project about some aspect of decision making that interests you.

in particular, we’ll cover:

* the psychology of everyday **cognitive biases**
* why it’s so hard to be **“rational""**
* the neuroscience of **how the brain handles uncertainty**
* how decision making is impaired in **psychiatric disorders**
* **computational models** of decision making
* how **ai** and **machine learning** can help us make better choices
* and so much more!

this class might be a great fit if you:

* want an **engaging, discussion-based** upper-div course (lectures will be podcasted but **participation** is worth a large chunk of your grade)
* want to understand more about why people make the choices they do
* want to sharpen your research and presentation skills

i am in the process of formally changing the prerequisites, so you are more than welcome to EASy request into it. **however, you should have some basic background in:**

* neuroscience / psychology concepts (e.g., COGS 17)
* statistics / probability / research methods
* be able to code in Python / MATLAB / R

more information, including **previous course evaluations and syllabi,** is available here: [**lucylai.com/teaching**](https://lucylai.com/teaching)

if you'd like to learn more about **me and/or my teaching philosophy,** go here: [**lucylai.com/ucsd**](http://lucylai.com/ucsd)

UCSD,hot,Its very likely I’m dropping out,EntertainmentAny4949,22,"(I would very much appreciate it if you read the whole thing before adding your rightful commentary)

I would consider the following a serious admission for how burdensome life has been for me lately; but I am now more convicted in the fact than ever, that this school is not really serving my interests anymore for what I thought I wanted for my own life, such that it’s now taken a very disparate piece of my own sanity and how I’ve been reacting to things, as well as how I’ve perceived external factors as well.

Being a transfer student, 8 hours away from home, arriving here from a place considered nowhere in CA (Modesto isn’t really the place to go for sensationalization) the matter of upgrading from a community college to the 3rd ranked Uni seemed like everything to me, and for a time, that’s all it was (Indeed, it was such an elitist mindset looking back). Granted, being a 3rd year for the first time here wasn’t the most convenient experience since even as an unapologetic extrovert, I had to work my ass off to get known, fall into a good space of people in regards to the clubs that served my interests at the time, and above all else, make sure I wasn’t a narcissist in such a competitive environment for, taking a step back and looking at it now, what I see as an unbearably uncertain and unpredictable job market, irrespective of whether you where even a post-grad student (it’s embarrassing to say, but only now, at 21, do I actually happen to have a legitimate job after all those years of unemployment, and hilariously enough, I like it a lot more than I do my own studies) 

But even so, with such privileged experiences, I’m afraid I can no longer make any breakthroughs in regards to my welfare in what I thought Political Science could do for me, to the extent that I no longer have any reason to want to see what it can bring me for the real world I’m gonna have to face. I will never admit that there wasn’t moments in my studies where I actually felt like I was in a legitimate state of scholarly rhythm, and I’ll even say, a sort of enthusiastic and passionate intersection between what I came to learn for real world topics when it came to readings and empirical articles alongside my own identity as a queer man. But I haven’t felt that way since I believe, winter quarter of 2025. These classes I have now, as it has been for a while with others, have fatigued and mentally burdened me to a very concerning degree, to the point where I had to reach out to the school’s services to prevent me from getting hurt amidst a really bad crisis I had earlier this month. I wholly believe if I continue for the sake of ego or pride, with the motive that I don’t desire to fail to obtain a degree that gives me a certain kind of status (because apparently thats more valued in this world than your actual autonomy as a person) I am gonna end up in a more dangerous spot than before, most likely towards irreversible damage, whatever that may look like. Before you even tell me to talk to resources like CAPS, or even visiting communities akin to my identity, know that I already have, and I’m just not satisfied, but rather disappointed to what I’ve seen (the referral process I was engaged in with CAPS back in Late February took from that point, to the literal beginning of April, all just to be out on a 3-5 week waitlist, so I gave up with that. I don’t doubt their providers are very helpful, but when a person like me, who’s already had a consistent history of therapy, with 4 different providers across different consistent basis’s dating all the way back to 2022, I believe there’s a threshold that’s crossed where a lack of therapy and coping skills for me to be articulate with my burdens is no longer the concern). 

Smaller burdens that came from me trying in communities include several inauthentic people I’ve met, who have conditionally befriended me on the basis of making sure they pass as well, and just fake folks all around for when I thought I could find people to engage in a loving relationship with intimacy wise, at least the ones I could scrap with such a socially dead school, even when you’re the shining example and not the outlier for these types of things. 

Right now I’m not in the best spot anywhere of me, so that’s all I can really muster up to say with such a considering opinion, but I want people to know that when such outliers like myself don’t exist; the isolation, the performance of status, the exhaustion from endless competition, the debt, and the loneliness of not fitting into dominant social molds, can actually help others live a better life than me, to which I hope they do, lord knows they need that status for whatever they chase. 
But over the painfully rigid machinery of higher education for what it often is: fast, expensive, alienating, and sometimes cruel in how little space it leaves for rest, healing, or authenticity, I’d much rather choose what’s left of my persons that I can consider “sane”. I don’t know what to do next, but I hope this long admission that I hope many have the patience in their literacy skills to read about (because I’m told a majority of new generations don’t read as lengthy as previous ones do anymore, which I hope is not true) makes anyone who doesn’t currently have the strength to talk about these types of burdens feel heard, seen, and above all else, un-isolated. I hope you’ve read through all this, for you are the true scholar.",0.7,0,22,False,32,True,False,False,self.UCSD,Discussion,1762815213.0,103795,False,False,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1otsr1p/its_very_likely_im_dropping_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1otsr1p/its_very_likely_im_dropping_out/

I was also planning to advertise it on Facebook marketplace, here on Reddit later on, on my instagram page, Etsy, YikYak (???), and ask my church if they knew anyone… 

I already have some of my rosaries sold at the old mission gift shop but they take 50% so I would preferably like to sell independently!

I would love to make this so students who share the interest can hang out, have lovely conversations, and gaze at the stars together. I'm posting here on Reddit to ask if anyone is interested in creating this club with me. I want to register this as an official campus organization (RCO) this fall, which means I am looking for two other people soon that want to work with me to register with UCSB and actually make this happen.
